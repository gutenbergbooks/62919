<h1>YODOGIMA</h1>

<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>

<p class="indent">Japan lay sweltering with uncertainty. Four centuries
of unbridled warfare had reduced her once
sturdy, centralized government to little more than a
revered impotency; the country had become the property
or the booty of its daimyos&mdash;those knights-errant,
the pride of a nation.</p>
<p class="indent">It was an age of military prowess, of unlicensed
chivalry, and to the victor belonged the spoils&mdash;till
wrested from him, by another more powerful or less
nice about the taking.</p>
<p class="indent">Shibata, grizzled and fair, sat upon the veranda,
looking out, over the ramparts, across the moats,
along the busied streets, to the mellowed hillsides
beyond. It was all his: gained by life&#146;s devoted, loyal
service, not to self, but to a chosen, rising superior.
It had now come time for him to assert his own
supremacy; the lord he served had met his doom,
gone the self same way that ambition for ages had
decreed&mdash;lay shrouded in state, with his good rich
blood dripping cold at the dagger&#146;s point.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Nobunaga conceived well,&#148; mused he, half aloud,
the tears fast welling in his great dark eyes, &#147;but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2" id="page2"></a>[pg&nbsp;2]</span>
Shibata, his oldest captain, alone shall finish what
the master undertook&mdash;Japan must be subdued.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">The skies darkened and the land-tempered breeze
calmed, as the big lord rested back upon the soft-matted
floor, gazing now afar over the hill tops
toward the starry vaulted space in the distance. A
little maiden, tender and eager, with black eyes and
darker, massive hair, stealing near, sat at his side.</p>
<p class="indent">Perhaps she, too, dreamed of the future, for she had
learned to love.</p>
<p class="indent">Learned to love as the Taira maidens, her ancestors,
of a half thousand years ago, had not attempted to
do. The deeds of daring and flights of fancy through
all those tumultuous centuries had not only given to
man the privileges of individuality, but wrested
woman from the thraldom of the ages and secured
to her a place and choice worthy her being.</p>
<p class="indent">Once again she might love and be loved&mdash;though
the father&#146;s command, the shogun&#146;s decree, or the
mikado&#146;s will stood over her, in fact, as law, and at
heart, both materially and spiritually.</p>
<p class="indent">Shibata did not at once turn to her, nor did he take
his eyes from the vision conjured within. Conscious
of her presence, the very thought burned and seared
deeper and firmer his ready-made if rigorous anticipations.
Fortune had given him a child in whom the
blood of Taira made possible the connection. His
own efforts had carved out a place and privilege.
Their chieftain&#146;s death afforded the opportunity. By
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page3" id="page3"></a>[pg&nbsp;3]</span>
the sacrifice of a child he himself would gain the
shogun&#146;s favor.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Yodogima?&#148; commanded he, after a while.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Yes, father.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;What were you just now thinking about?&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Amida, most honorable father.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Your own, or some other fair one&#146;s goddess of
mercy; you are so considerate, my daughter?&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Mine, dear father,&#148; replied she, without any
change of expression or an apparent heart-beat.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Humph!&#148; ejaculated Shibata, thoughtfully; &#147;it
is strange how affinities get mixed; I myself possessed
somewhat a consciousness&mdash;of Amaterasu,
though, the goddess of love. I wonder what is the
time; the hour must draw nigh: the barons will
soon be gathering; it is really getting dark. You may
retire now, to make ready; Katsutoya shall be present,
and your maid must grow impatient&mdash;though, I
promise, nature has left really little to be done, and
you need not blush; a father is privileged, you know.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">In the great hall, at another side of the high-walled
inclosure&mdash;with its ponderous gate and turreted
angles, surrounding a network of tile-covered, wood-lacquered
buildings or grained-post colonnades, with
here and there a shrine or a bell or a row of lanterns
or a fretwork of gold&mdash;sat Sakuma and Gonroku, the
one Shibata&#146;s chief captain and the other his natural
son.</p>
<p class="indent">Sakuma had just returned with added laurels; a
new fief or more had been wrested from Uesugi (to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page4" id="page4"></a>[pg&nbsp;4]</span>
the eastward) his master&#146;s old-time foe and a daimyo
of undoubted rank. To beat him in battle was no
mean feat, and this, Sakuma&#146;s latest triumph, had
once more demonstrated the power and efficiency of
Kitanoshi, Shibata&#146;s stronghold, in whose castle all
the great barons formerly subject to Nobunaga were
then about to assemble. Shibata, the lord daimyo of
all Echizen, had issued the invitations, ostensibly to
cement friendships and perpetuate in authority the
house of their late master, Nobunaga. Gonroku, too,
felt the force of his father&#146;s growing ascendency, but
may have been just now a little jealous; duties elsewhere,
to the westward, escorting Katsutoya to Nagahama
castle&mdash;lately surrendered to them by Hideyoshi&mdash;had
disappointed and kept him personally
from the latest battle field.</p>
<p class="indent">The perfume of azalea freshened the room; lanterns
suspended everywhere cast a subdued light into the
farthest corners; soft, velvety matting set in oblongs
edged round with black-lacquered frames covered the
floor and a huge vase of old Satsuma ware, with a
single scroll hung at the back, constituted the only
decoration. Sakuma and Gonroku had come in early,
and seating themselves at one side spoke in low anxious
tones or whacked cautiously their pipes, as convenience
required, against the one hibachi (brazier)
shared between them.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;You did nobly, Sakuma: my father&#146;s house owes
much to your abilities.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">Sakuma&#146;s eyes sparkled, but the daring, impulsive
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page5" id="page5"></a>[pg&nbsp;5]</span>
soldier, middle-aged and aggressive, made no answer.
He knew this Gonroku: knew him to be a chip off
the block he had served well and truly: had come to
regard their praise and assurance at its true worth.
Yodogima&#146;s words would have pleased him more;
she inherited well her mother&#146;s traits. The Taira
stock had taken deep root in the princess, and above
all else Sakuma worshipped at this ancient particular
shrine. Then, again, she had advised him somewhat
of her wishes&mdash;without at all disclosing any motive,
though he may have guessed as much&mdash;and he had
sworn in secrecy to do her service at the cost of
death; be that his own, or his master&#146;s, or his lordship&#146;s
good and faithful son&#146;s.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;It is less than I would do, were Shibata my age,&#148;
replied Sakuma, after a little, striking his metal pipe
harder than was polite against the resonant hibachi.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Father is rather old, and a bit fidgety; but Gonroku
is young and in good favors: pray don&#146;t overlook
that.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;But you forget Katsutoya. I must confess that
I thought better of&mdash;our lord&#146;s age than his placing
at Nagahama, in the front, between Kitanoshi and
Kyoto, the capital, that&mdash;fellow, only an adopted
son, even though he carry the shogun&#146;s blood&mdash;poor
stuff, in these days&mdash;a thing any true knight
might fairly doubt.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Sh&mdash;h&mdash;h. Not above a whisper, my good
Sakuma.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Why so? These walls have no ears, I promise.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page6" id="page6"></a>[pg&nbsp;6]</span>
&#147;But Hideyoshi has. They say his spies are everywhere,
and anywhere; and some&mdash;I told you so;
there comes Junkei, now.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;He&#146;s an ass&mdash;frivolous, foolish, and a mask: a
counterpart of the monkey-faced Hideyoshi himself.
I shall not rise&mdash;what say you, Gonroku?&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Flout him; I take it his superior shall fare no
better at the hands of the daimyos.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">Junkei pranced in, to the center of the hall, and
without pretending to see anybody, much less their
host&#146;s two worthy attendants, turned upon his heel,
shouting:</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Behold; the Great; a Hideyoshi approaches!&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">No sooner had the echo died than Hideyoshi, the
but recently created daimyo of Omi; self-intended
master of Nobunaga&#146;s leavings and loudly proclaimed
protector of the peace; with the commonest kind of
low down blood in his veins, and the largest aspirations
in his mind; weasen-faced, small, stooped, bullet-eyed
and fiercely aggressive, yet plausibly reserved,
angled his way in, displaced his long-sword, handed
it to his own attendant, Junkei&mdash;who, himself, hung
it upon the wall&mdash;and squatting in the middle of the
hall, at one end&mdash;where only the host should sit&mdash;called
loudly for a hibachi and attendance.</p>
<p class="indent">Hearing the noise and discerning the occasion,
their host entered, followed by Ikeda, daimyo of
Settsu; Niwa, of Wakasa; Maeda; Takigawa, and
other invited guests, with their attendants, including
Kuroda and Takiyama, noted captains under Hideyoshi,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page7" id="page7"></a>[pg&nbsp;7]</span>
who had the decency, if not purpose, to comply
with established etiquet and recognized custom.</p>
<p class="indent">Shibata belonged to the old school, the bakufu,
acknowledged only the bushido (code of chivalry),
and when those daimyos observed Hideyoshi, an
upstart and outsider, self-made and wilful, usurping
their host&#146;s privileged place and rank, feelings something
akin to shame if not resentment possessed them,
one and all alike.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Yes, gentlemen; I am here,&#148; grinned Hideyoshi,
rubbing his hands and peering among them&mdash;without
deigning to arise&mdash;"ready for business. Our
lord, Nobunaga, good and great, as he was, is dead.
The work, though, which he began, must be carried
on. It behooves us, his once trusted followers, to
get together. Come close up, round Hideyoshi; who,
perchance, feels the loss more keenly than any other.
Shibata, my old friend and good fellow, bring in the
sake (wine). We barons need cheer, and Hideyoshi
in particular&mdash;&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Intends to shampoo lord Shibata. That is why
he so audaciously usurps his place,&#148; interposed
Sakuma, coming threateningly up.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Well said, Sakuma; I remember his doing so,
once before. It is, though, a long time now&mdash;. How
do you, Hideyoshi? Is your hand steady, and capable?
now that you are a daimyo? like others of us?
with less face? however?&#148; remarked Shibata, tauntingly.</p>
<p class="indent">A low twitter and ready gabble ensued. Only
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page8" id="page8"></a>[pg&nbsp;8]</span>
Kuroda and Takiyama remained serious or composed.
Junkei danced about, unconscious of any wrong, till
Hideyoshi spoke:</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Compose yourself, Junkei. Did not the queen
Shomu once attend a beggar? Why should not
Hideyoshi shampoo Shibata? His hand is yet true,
and the heart pure. Come Shibata: prepare yourself.
Hideyoshi shall again serve his oldest friend.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">Such complacency in the face of so mean a taunt
fairly unnerved Hideyoshi&#146;s bitterest enemies, and at
least some of Shibata&#146;s less staunch supporters really
felt that such a man&mdash;one who could so govern his
temper and conserve his patience&mdash;must of necessity
be the greater man.</p>
<p class="indent">Hideyoshi began the shampooing as if wont to do a
real service, and Shibata to hide his only too patent
chagrin and sorrow at such defeat pretended to sleep.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;It is only the friendship between us here assembled
that restrains our enemies scattered everywhere
around. If by surrendering Nagahama to Shibata I
have strengthened: if by shampooing him I have cemented
that bond, then Hideyoshi has done a good service&mdash;perhaps
the end, if not the method, shall be
deemed worthy, if not befitting.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">So saying, Hideyoshi left off further effort at conciliation,
and withdrawing proceeded thence, toward
Kyoto, with a visible escort of only some three hundred
men.</p>
<p class="indent">Sakuma would have followed, possibly to no small
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page9" id="page9"></a>[pg&nbsp;9]</span>
purpose, but there was one present, a small baron,
hitherto unnoticed, who saw farther than Shibata
divined. Ieyasu, a prince from Mikawa, advised that
Hideyoshi be allowed to go his way unmolested.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page10" id="page10"></a>[pg&nbsp;10]</span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>

<p class="indent">Katsutoya, in whom Shibata was personally
most deeply interested, had not put in an
appearance: yet no pressing duties at Nagahama or
elsewhere could possibly have kept him away.</p>
<p class="indent">Though of no particular consequence, this young
prince was generally conceded to be the clandestine
son of Yoshiaki, the then de jure shogun, who had
been, a number of years theretofore, deposed and
exiled by Nobunaga, as was customary, to one of the
many monasteries in the hills of Hiyeisan to the rear
of Kyoto. Shibata, Nobunaga&#146;s chief captain, no
doubt with an eye to the future, had early taken in
the friendless youth and by adopting him as a son&mdash;with
the rank and title of a captain&mdash;had given him
respectable standing: perhaps intending him to be
the possible means of later on obtaining a commission
from the shogun, himself; thus legalizing his
warfare against his neighbors&mdash;a thing every daimyo
of consequence aspired above all else.</p>
<p class="indent">Shibata, chafed at Katsutoya&#146;s omission or disobedience
and Hideyoshi&#146;s keen eye, readily discerned the
possibilities of so potent a failure.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Junkei?&#148; commanded he, as he and his train approached,
on the way to Kyoto, the recently surrendered
castle of Nagahama.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page11" id="page11"></a>[pg&nbsp;11]</span>
&#147;Yes, my lord.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Tell Takiyama Hideyoshi would pay Katsutoya a
visit, en route.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;What!&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Fool! Control yourself; do as bid; and with a
good face.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;But Katsutoya is an enemy&#146;s favorite, and we have
only a small guard.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Hence worth our while; and do you comprehend?
Cease conjecturing; Hideyoshi knows. Nobunaga
is dead: Yodogima, mine.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">They three met in council at the narrow pass leading
to Katsutoya&#146;s new charge. It was dark, and
Takiyama conjured new dangers. Hideyoshi bade
him disarm and lead the way.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;It is madness,&#148; whispered Takiyama, more
thoughtful of himself than of his duty.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;You, a Christian, would bear arms, visiting upon
a neighbor? Is that your religion?&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">Takiyama faltered, and Hideyoshi proceeded. His
own sword had not been cast aside; courtesy forbade
it; but upon their arrival and presentation the fearless
daimyo of the new school unsheathed his master
weapon and reversing it tendered the hilt to Katsutoya;
who was so bewildered with respect for his
visitor&#146;s confidence that no time was lost in the forming
of a friendship that for once set a new example and
again sent Hideyoshi on his way the wiser for his
daring.</p>
<p class="indent">Hideyoshi had gained an important advantage by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page12" id="page12"></a>[pg&nbsp;12]</span>
a newly tried agency, diplomacy&mdash;a thing his compeers,
and even Nobunaga his superior, had deigned
despise. Triumphant at Kitanoshi and successful in
Nagahama, a double prize at stake and a soldier like
Kuroda to enforce the decree, why not proclaim himself
at once?</p>
<p class="indent">Nobunaga&#146;s corpse lie in state at the capital, and
who were there to dispute Hideyoshi, now that
Shibata remained absent, nursing the vexations of
sore defeat?</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Junkei?&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Yes, my lord.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Call Kuroda.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;I think he sleeps; you know, we just arrived&mdash;it
is only a trice since we left&mdash;and Kyoto is miles
distant&mdash;&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Babbler! Does Hideyoshi sleep? Bring Kuroda,
before your neck and my scimitar have tried their
want.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Kuroda, are you Hideyoshi&#146;s captain?&#148; asked
Hideyoshi, presently.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Yes, most honorable master.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Then why sleep?&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;It is nature&#146;s call.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Away with nature; the gods are omnipotent.
Would you, Kuroda, serve less? No? Then listen.
Hideyoshi defies both God and man. Marshal your
troops. I proclaim myself.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;They sleep.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Give then gold, and they shall awaken.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page13" id="page13"></a>[pg&nbsp;13]</span>
&#147;But how use them&mdash;my instructions&mdash;I have
nothing&mdash;&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;What? Kuroda, my captain, a beggar? Have I
not confidence in you? A better age dawns.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Command me.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;That is more like it. Listen. Nobunaga lies
unburied. Let all Japan witness the ceremony. The
gods proclaim their precedence; Hideyoshi shall do
reverence first: then the barons, widows, and pretenders
may wrangle out their proper rank.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;But our ancestors?&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Bosh! With Kuroda and Shintoism on the one
hand and Takiyama and Christianity on the other,
Hideyoshi shall wrought anew. Reverence might better
rot; manhood waxes original.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">The shogun forthwith appointed Hideyoshi major
general of all the mikado&#146;s forces&mdash;gold had brought
him, too, from his hiding: a ready request afforded
the occasion&mdash;and all the daimyos were commanded
to appear and do homage. The wealth and the fashion
of the nation were invited. The whole populace was
instructed to come. Such a gathering, and so bold
a venture, marked a new era. All the best and the
most vigorous, the intellectual and the ambitious, the
strong and the brave, rallied to the call of a thirsty
leader, chose to lay their lives at the altar of endeavor,
and to grapple for the first time with an individualism
that bade fair to spring from the very roots of society,
and to thrive&mdash;only one man stood silently but resolutely
in the way.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page14" id="page14"></a>[pg&nbsp;14]</span>
Shibata responded to the call, and all the daimyos
recently subservient to the dead chief were there.
Others came in person, or sent suitable representatives;
the common people under Hideyoshi&#146;s immediate
sway rallied in numbers; samurai, farmers, artisans,
and merchants alike responded: such a gathering
of wealth and power, rags and poverty, never before
had assembled to do reverence.</p>
<p class="indent">Daitokige temple had been designated by Hideyoshi
as the most suitable place for the ceremonies
and workmen rendered it into a veritable dreamland.
Flowers and bunting and gold and purple contrasted
significantly with the white gowns and mourning
hoods worn by the rich and the poor alike.</p>
<p class="indent">Shibata and his suite had been purposely assigned
to the place of honor. Nowhere were Hideyoshi and
his followers to be seen&mdash;they had apparently vanished
as if of the past or in the spirit world, along
with Nobunaga, their fallen chief. Yodogima sat
in the center, surrounded by her maids and friends,
with their costumes of white or regalias of gold,
banked against a background of wealth and refinement.
Far up the hillsides and all round in front and
to the rear, sat or trod, mingled and stared, solid
masses of straggling groups of knighted chevaliers or
gaping underlings, fair maidens and rosy-cheeked
damsels. Presently the huge gong sounded and everybody
there bowed reverently: the bonzes (priests),
kneeling round the sepulchre said their prayers, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page15" id="page15"></a>[pg&nbsp;15]</span>
Shintoism, Buddhism, and Christianity alike awaited
God, conjured a Spirit, bade the Overman speak.</p>
<p class="indent">Hideyoshi, with the infant heir, Samboshi, Nobunaga&#146;s
grandson, in his arms, stood forth; whence,
no one knew. A voice, amid silence, read from the
tomb the order of the day.</p>
<p class="indent">Calmly facing the shrine and beckoning the multitude,
Hideyoshi then spoke:</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;I, Hideyoshi, protector of the throne and conservator
of the peace, command that you and each of
you, loyal subjects, give heed unto Nobunaga&#146;s will;
here and thence to you voiced by the good and great
Yamato-Dake (god of war). Let be what I proclaim.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">Thereat two white falcons spread their wings and
flapped away into space. A loud roar and din as of
horses trampling and speeding issued from the temple.
Armed guards sprang forward everywhere&mdash;out of
the temples, behind the gates, into the streets, around
the palace, amid the hills&mdash;and Kuroda stood ready
to strike down the lowliest and the highest who dared
raise a hand or voice.</p>
<p class="indent">Shibata slunk back, and amid the confusion an old
woman seemingly, clad in black with drawn hood,
carrying a strange bundle, whispered in Yodogima&#146;s
ear. In a twinkling the knowing princess had donned
the disguise and with no other apparent escort made
her way toward Kitanoshi, safely tucked away behind
the mountain range in the distance.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page16" id="page16"></a>[pg&nbsp;16]</span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>

<p class="indent">The day dawned bright, and all Kitanoshi livened
with anticipation. Great masses of foliage
bended or thirsted under the golden dew drops that
trickled and glistened in the creeping sun&#146;s modest
warmth. Everywhere men and women, clad in comfort
or donning their due, wafting song-words or
grumbling at fate, busied themselves with that beginning
which marks the endless round of time&#146;s eternal
quest and God&#146;s immutable law. Little had been
left to the wild, for here the untrained had long ago
found his tenantless haven; the ox and the fragile alike
had surrendered to the call of higher being; here,
where the human over-lords the beast, man went his
way: marveled only at the beauties of God-striven
energy.</p>
<p class="indent">Shibata eagerly tripped again into the council
chamber; years of earnestness sat lightly upon his
shoulders; Takigawa of Ise was there to meet him;
both had suffered intolerable insult at Hideyoshi&#146;s
ruthless assumption of authority, and now that others
more vain or less discerning sought shelter under their
own disconsolate roofs these two, more subtle, if less
capable, would consolidate forces and move upon what
they none too soon conceived to be a common necessity.</p>
<p class="indent">Ieyasu arose later; life to him seemed the better
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page17" id="page17"></a>[pg&nbsp;17]</span>
conserved in leisure; and while Shibata, his host, and
Takigawa, his neighbor, wrangled the exigencies of
war, or planned doubtful expediencies, a more inviting,
though perhaps no less urgent prospect lolled and
soothed the gallant young daimyo into more than a
customary morning&#146;s peaceful dreaming of love&#146;s
over-powering, life-building virtue.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Yodogima, my Yodogima,&#148; whispered he, as the
great red sun arose and cast its fiery rays into the
opened room around him.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;You are mine, for Amaterasu, the good sun goddess,
reveals you, sweet Yodogima, in every trace of
her lovely countenance. Come closer, oh, my darling;
come closer, that Ieyasu may feel, may know, may
live the divine. You are my savior, earth&#146;s true
progenitor, and the stars in heaven reveal but your
eternity. O, Amaterasu; O, Jimmu; O, Yodogima&mdash;my
Light, my Purpose, my God.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">The waterfall in the distance murmured its time-honored
song of powers subdued. The pine, dwarfed
into miniature proportions, revealed the potency of
patience rigidly enforced. Nodding stones here and
there symbolized again and anon the power of truth.
A half-hidden lakelet in the distance conjured a magnitude
there impossible, and from the castle crag in
the garden&#146;s center, receding round to the dim horizon
beyond, no thing remained untouched or thought
neglected in the making of this a place not alone
inhabitable but as well inviting.</p>
<p class="indent">A lone lespedeza straggled and bloomed significantly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page18" id="page18"></a>[pg&nbsp;18]</span>
close at the wall side; where, perhaps, ages ago
its fair proteg&#233; long since a goddess had met and won
with no more grace a far less gallant lover. Would
Yodogima come there too?</p>
<p class="indent">Ieyasu breathed contentedly of its fragrance and
willed afresh that herein lie the potency of man&#146;s everlasting
generation.</p>
<p class="indent">A cuckoo came and cocked itself upon the side
house-sill.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Sing to me,&#148; commanded Ieyasu, bending forward
intently.</p>
<p class="indent">The cuckoo stood stark still, amazed at the sound
of his voice. Some ominous thing&mdash;too uncanny for
thought, more than consciousness would reveal&mdash;presently
suggested, &#147;I&#146;ll kill the cuckoo if he does
not sing.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;No, no; not I&mdash;only Nobunaga could say that.
Ieyasu&mdash;&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Sing to me,&#148; demanded he this time, straightening
up defiantly.</p>
<p class="indent">The bird ruffled its plumage, as if ready to fly or
do battle, and conscience bade him, &#147;I&#146;ll make the
cuckoo sing.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Ah! That sounds like Hideyoshi. Those are his
sentiments. Ieyasu&mdash;&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Sing to me,&#148; said he now, leaning back adroitly.</p>
<p class="indent">The little thing tucked its wings, and closing one
eye stood confidingly in the warm sun&#146;s rays. Ieyasu&mdash;only
said:</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;I&#146;ll wait till the cuckoo sings.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page19" id="page19"></a>[pg&nbsp;19]</span>
And he did wait&mdash;but presently his eyes were
opened by the sound of a voice that arose not from
nature, nor from the ethereal, for his own consciousness
revealed it, and all the senses rose and the soul
stooped to a common level. Ieyasu, the one prince
who had resisted every temptation to yield at the
call of devotion; who had withstood the force of
power, ignored the claims of conquest, and shunned at
the taste of wealth; who had succeeded to opportunity,
yet studied its consequence; had held his own
against, without intruding upon others; partaken of
the fruits of life and looked forward into the indeterminate
beyond&mdash;had welcomed any test that man or
God invoked, now stood dazed at the charm of
woman&#146;s potency.</p>
<p class="indent">He looked up, and the same green vine still carried
its own true offering, the cuckoo had long flown, the
sun rose and the earth responded, but underneath it
all, above the rest, and whence he knew not, came the
call that for good or for bad, at once and for all, too
soon or too late, moved him to do and to know.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Come to me,&#148; cried he, thrilled with the notes that
issued, loftier than the cuckoo&#146;s, more heavenly than
are the skies.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Come to me,&#148; repeated he, yet composedly, &#147;for it
is you, Yodogima; none other could sing so sweetly.
I must have you.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">Still the tanka (verse) issued, its soul-stirring message
only tightened the grip of one human heart upon
another. For ages these gentle maidens and their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page20" id="page20"></a>[pg&nbsp;20]</span>
ardent suitors had dwelt upon its perfection. No base
word had been left to mar its symmetry; not a thought
of mortality jarred the sense; the unreal had been
made real; yet hitherto in his mind no voice had risen
to essay its value.</p>
<p class="indent">Ieyasu listened and Yodogima rendered; sang as
if possessed of a spirit never before felt or touched,
and Ieyasu hurled at constancy&#146;s feet all that tradition
or enlightenment had vainly invoked.</p>
<p class="indent">A power unseen, unfelt, unknown, held supreme.
The best that the energies of men had yet devised
stood symbolized in this one man Ieyasu&mdash;nobody
disputed that: not even he himself at heart could deny
the truth. The exigencies of birth, the value of training,
and the force of purpose alike marked this man
as a leader among men. A full consciousness of the
responsibilities urged him unequivocally to the fulfillment
of his mission. He would do for his kind no
less than the gods had done for theirs.</p>
<p class="indent">But here, confronting him, arose, commanding attention,
a new authority.</p>
<p class="indent">Heretofore men and women had been considered
one&mdash;man. Were it possible, after all, that they, too,
were separated by a gulf as wide as that between
heaven and earth? A destiny as incomprehensible as
nirvana itself? A province as distinct as that revealed
by the principles positive and negative? And did
God but stand between and the devil behind them?
Was it the devil between and the gods behind? Or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page21" id="page21"></a>[pg&nbsp;21]</span>
were the gods beckoning them alone, and unhindered
except by man himself?</p>
<p class="indent">These were stirring questions for Ieyasu, who had
conceived Shinto, then suffered Buddha, at last to
become threatened of Christ.</p>
<p class="indent">Thought crowded upon him till his head seemed in
a whirl and only the body responded&mdash;to what he
did not know; no lone man could tell.</p>
<p class="indent">Yodogima sat upon the lacquered bench, underneath
the spreading lespedeza, innocent of a thought
beyond the duty to which she, the eldest daughter of
the host and betrothed of a superior, Katsutoya, had
been assigned. Her place in the household made it
incumbent upon her to entertain at this hour of the
day a guest and patron of the rank and standing of
Ieyasu.</p>
<p class="indent">The flowers overhead bespoke her innocence; the
verse she sang portrayed a devotion unquestioned;
while the dressing of her hair, the manner of her
garments, and the method of her doing signified an
age, station and disposition not to be mistaken.</p>
<p class="indent">Yet the pathos and the inspiration of her voice
revealed an inner consciousness that is neither bought
of preferment nor satisfied with precedent. The plaintive
mournful notes, the anxious eager accents, the
glad forgiving tones, all invited repose, stirred the
interest and awakened impulse. Ieyasu conjured
within his over-burdened conscience a duty consistent
alike with inner compulsion and outward exigencies.
He would surrender position, opportunity, everything
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page22" id="page22"></a>[pg&nbsp;22]</span>
to save his manhood: the very soul of being called
aloud from the uttermost depths of unreality&mdash;the
real paled with insignificance, the things around him
shrivelled into nothingness, the earth itself rocked
upon an uncertain axis, and the heavens alone bade
him do.</p>
<p class="indent">He would have cried out, but words seemed a
mockery; gathered her in his arms, had it not been
vulgar; touched her with his lips, were not the flesh
a repulsive thing; entranced her with a look, coaxed
her with promises, inveigled her with deception, stolen
her, coerced her, done anything to get her&mdash;but the
tenets of his religion forbade.</p>
<p class="indent">Numberless generations of denial had made of him
a man. All the instincts of brute being stood lost
behind the ages of progressive enlightenment. The
tutelage of an ancestry that fancy painted looking
down with each star twinkle, that science tore from
the hard face of phenomenon, that existence itself
proclaimed with every heart-beat, guided this man and
this woman toward an only rational attainment, to a
predestined, uncontrollable end.</p>
<p class="indent">Man in his weakness had thought differently&mdash;no
age had brought forth more than conformity, here or
elsewhere on earth; history, travel, and science had
proven that, and these men and women were not
devoid of understanding&mdash;had conceived the earth
as of heaven, conjured their state to be coexistent
with the earth, and made man at once a master and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page23" id="page23"></a>[pg&nbsp;23]</span>
its slave: woman had become the handmaid of fortune,
the instrument of fate, and the idol of the gods.</p>
<p class="indent">Ieyasu pondered, and Yodogima wrought.</p>
<p class="indent">Clothed in garments that obliterated all trace of
form or suggestion, of a texture that hid the weave and
a making that disclosed no stitch, yet displayed a
handiwork as perfect as it was simple; her hair waved
and fastened round without an ornament or a device
that could be seen; her feet sandalled in earthen-like
wood, and her nails pink and cheeks olive and eyes
trustful, Yodogima revealed in her presence and strove
with a purpose all that time had been able to wrest
from an humbler beginning. The green turf, the
broken sky line, birds of plumage and the fragrance
of flowers, the open expanse or covered nook, all
bespoke a care and a concern intended to move and to
weld mankind.</p>
<p class="indent">Yodogima remained seated, underneath the shade,
amid an environment made, not creative. The sun
drove its rays fiercer and more propellingly against
Ieyasu&#146;s stand. It remained for him to give; she
could but receive. Love beamed from every distance,
floated in close upon them, arose subtilely within,
grew hard without, compelling, exacting, and vital.
Ieyasu strode down the chiselled steps&mdash;overcome
with the joy of doing, forgetful of every mandate in
restraint&mdash;and falling upon his knees before her,
whispered:</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Yodogima, I love you.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">Her song only quickened, then lowered a little, perhaps
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page24" id="page24"></a>[pg&nbsp;24]</span>
the least bit pathetically.</p>
<p class="indent">There was neither exultation nor regret, though
for the moment a faint realization of duty&mdash;arising
from a constantly receding past, battling against an
urgently progressive present&mdash;flushed apparently,
then whitened perceptibly her face: she sang more
sweetly, if less deeply, than before.</p>
<p class="indent">Ieyasu&#146;s eyes fell to the pebbled floor and his soul
seared with anticipation.</p>
<p class="indent">Would she bid defiance away, under the stress of
heart? Or would she starve self, to uphold tradition?
The tanka progressed, and Ieyasu trembled underneath
advancement&#146;s harsher demands; time had
wrought his inevitable change. Ages ago his nearest
ancestors had snatched the coveted morsel and
gorged unchallenged behind a fiercer deity. Yet still
farther back and over that again stood Amaterasu,
benign, supreme, unquestioned. Whence this fleeting
thought of man? Were he but the crude remnant
of an unbroken descent thence the God of gods?
Man, only a product of decline, groping his way from
past to present; often recovering, then again but
losing; only to sink still lower, more hopelessly, till
dust once and forever claimed him? Were hell his
goal, or heaven his due? The tanka alone answered.</p>
<p class="indent">Her notes quickened, and it strengthened him:
there remained but a single verse, and it seemed as if
breathing were a penalty.</p>
<p class="indent">Sakuma passed them by, at some distance, in the
garden below. The concerned captain had just left
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page25" id="page25"></a>[pg&nbsp;25]</span>
the council chamber, and walking as if in a hurry,
toward the armory, not far distant, underneath the
inner ramparts, at the farther side of the castle enclosure,
without observing the lovers, well hidden behind
the overhanging vine&#146;s long drooping branches&mdash;they
were as unmindful of him as he was careless about
them&mdash;Sakuma only heard, though marvelled its
more than usual pathos the last informing strains of
Yodogima&#146;s world-appealing message.</p>
<p class="indent">Knowing though who her auditor might be and
divining the occasion for such feeling&mdash;only the
last measures had reached him distinctly&mdash;there
appeared no need for any closer contact: the grizzled
veteran went his way, determined, however convinced.</p>
<p class="indent">Yodogima and Ieyasu both had risen, and standing
facing, each bowed earnestly, meditating deeply
the responsibilities they had then for all time of their
own will so freely assumed.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Pardon me, Ieyasu; I did not mean to be
irreverent. Some ungovernable impulse truly possessed
me&mdash;relieve and forget.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Forget I could not, and why relieve? Is it not
meet to take?&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;You know my father&#146;s will.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;And I know yours.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;And your own?&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Yes.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;You disadvantage me.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;I&#146;ll prove it&#146;s not a quandary.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Then I am yours, for I have confidence in you, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page26" id="page26"></a>[pg&nbsp;26]</span>
confidence rightfully bestowed is truly real liberty
won.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Quite democratic, Yodogima, and&mdash;perchance
justly so; were men without some wholesome check
the world should sooner reach its final doom.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;But we live, Ieyasu, and&mdash;is not life worth the
while? Does it not portend something more than
merely living?&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;It would were it not for the price&mdash;but trust me,
Yodogima; I live only for you.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;I do.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Then you are mine, and the world can take care of
itself.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">They bowed low, and Ieyasu, strengthened, as only
a wholesome appreciation can strengthen, took his
leave, fully determined to remove every obstacle to
the consummation of a love that had grown and
ripened from childhood associations, that germinated
with an earliest contact and sent its roots deep down
into the fertile soil of a consciously overpowering
affinity.</p>
<p class="indent">Yodogima stood still at first, fairly puzzled at the
daring of Ieyasu&#146;s conception.</p>
<p class="indent">All that time or task had taught her seemed crushed
underneath a possible truth. Were man but a stretch
between something and nothingness, then generation
must be a curse and love only a consequence. And
if it were not true and marriage were a thing in which
a parent, the state, or society at large rightly had an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page27" id="page27"></a>[pg&nbsp;27]</span>
interest, then her answer had been a crime; she had
transgressed, and therein must lie the sin.</p>
<p class="indent">Then she remembered that the sages had sung in all
lands and at all times of man&#146;s strength and woman&#146;s
worse than weakness.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;I will trust him and he shall prove the truth.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">Yodogima ran out of the bowery and into the open:
Ieyasu turned, the sun reflected its rays, and in that
parting look, only a tender glance, a message from
thence, she beheld her God.</p>
<p class="indent">Ieyasu hurried on, toward his mission; the noise
at the armory, Shibata&#146;s high purpose, and his own
inner determination bade him act quickly and knowingly
were he to save Yodogima&mdash;he did not apprehend
Sakuma; Ieyasu was only human; other exigencies
than his there were in more directions than
one.</p>
<p class="indent">Now that her lover had gone, removed himself
beyond the fetch or force of feeling, Yodogima, too,
at once realized with all the ableness of intellect at
her command&mdash;strengthened and driven by a will
as heartless as it was unremitting&mdash;a duty that till
then had lain dormant under the influence of a controlling
if perhaps inexcusable situation. Not that she
pondered the course that he would pursue, no more the
virtue of their undertaking; it were for him to determine
successfulness: God alone might judge them
true or false&mdash;but her father, the one who had given
her place and opportunity, who had conceived differently,
was at that very moment embarking upon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page28" id="page28"></a>[pg&nbsp;28]</span>
enterprises and assuming responsibilities wholly
dependent upon her.</p>
<p class="indent">And one false step, a single controverted thought,
must necessarily lead to his uncertain downfall&mdash;his
death had been a small thing, her own a welcome
sacrifice, but the bushido! Hell itself were a blessing
as compared with everlasting disgrace.</p>
<p class="indent">The blood fairly froze in her veins, thought refused
obeisance, fain spirit paled at the consequence, and
only duty urged her now; she must speak, she would
save him, she should uphold tradition, even at the cost
of self.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Father,&#148; begged she, accosting him at the threshold
of his abandoned chamber, his friend, Takigawa,
supporting him vainly, close at one side.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Yes, daughter.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Please return into the house; I should like to
speak with you.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;What? A daughter thrust herself into a father&#146;s
affairs? Did you hear that, Takigawa?&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;It&#146;s like a woman: I can retire, and let her have
her say, if only for once; it can do no harm, Shibata.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Not so, Takigawa. Wives pleading, daughters
interfering, and everybody for himself, these days&mdash;I
tell you Hideyoshi is the curse of this land. On with
the business, and when Shibata has laid low the last
of them, stood right above might and attained his
rightful place, then Katsutoya may rule and Yodogima
can speak&mdash;consolation is a husband&#146;s due, obedience
a parent&#146;s command.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page29" id="page29"></a>[pg&nbsp;29]</span>
&#147;Honorable father&mdash;&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Tut, tut; Shibata&#146;s child knows not irreverence.
See her, my lord? Ha, ha; how gracefully she
falls! An angel could not look sweeter, there is no
better plaything&mdash;let us be off, Takigawa, lest we
disturb her and miss the enemy; it is a long way to
Shizugataka.&#148;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<p class="indent">Presently the hillsides, far out over the noised-up
city, rang with the bustle and cry of &#147;To
arms&#148;. No patriot there, not a samurai&#146;s mother, but
thrilled with the joy and strengthened at the bidding
of higher endeavor.</p>
<p class="indent">Only the mean, the weak, and the unpatriotic would
question expediency; small men with little souls
might buy to sell again; others of brawn, their minds
a mirage, fashion the wares, drones and idlers drive
and shout their wives and children to plant and draw&mdash;men
and women, humans with a purpose and a
promise higher and nobler than grubbing for food or
haggling for exchange or bartering for gold served a
usefulness, encouraged a hope, and pointed the way
toward that rendering which make men large; the
ideal portended a reality which bid them not, ever,
stoop to sordid, useless gain.</p>
<p class="indent">The lines formed, and no more pleasing scene had
come down through time or fancy; men with hardened
muscle and bronzed arms, their eyes sparkling and
step quickened, with spears levelled and cutlasses
buckled on, tramped to time and listened with intent.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Open the gates, and down with the bridge,&#148;
shouted the captain, as a hundred thousand brave
troops turned their backs upon peace and stores to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page31" id="page31"></a>[pg&nbsp;31]</span>
face the exigencies of uncertain warfare&mdash;an underling&#146;s
last sad gasp at fate and the godly&#146;s only reach
to greatness.</p>
<p class="indent">War&mdash;the one thing that makes man better than
his neighbor, bridges the chasm between life and
death, raises a hope superior within. War&mdash;the
slogan of nature, and the handmaid of creation. War&mdash;the
savior of mankind, at the cost of brute, stirred
them as it had their fathers to superhuman, transcendent
energy.</p>
<p class="indent">They marched past the shops&mdash;in which sycophants
wrangled this and that; through the woods
where cutters and hewers sweat or chewed; over the
plains, amid sustenance born of fain indifference&mdash;into
the mountains, lofty, grand and inspiring.</p>
<p class="indent">The roads ran smooth and easy up the long sloping
ascent, they were builded and used, for a like purpose,
long before Shibata&#146;s rise had conjured sublimity&#146;s
ultimate pass. Presently sounds beyond
echoed again the uncertainties of dame progress. The
dizzy heights scaled measured accurately the cost of
further effort. Ominous clouds darkened the way.
Shibata at last lagged, and a fox leaped from the roadside.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Gonroku! Gonroku!&#148; whispered Shibata, springing
from his chair and peering into darkness.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Yes, father,&#148; replied the son, a little surprised, but
not altogether unconvinced.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;The enemy! Cannot you see them? They come
in columns touching the seas: ranks receding&mdash;I cannot
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page32" id="page32"></a>[pg&nbsp;32]</span>
number them&mdash;reaching beyond the horizon.
Katsutoya leads them.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Impossible,&#148; shouted Sakuma. &#147;On with the
march.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Listen,&#148; whispered Shibata, now white in the face
and unsteady of foot.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;They do mock Sakuma,&#148; ventured Gonroku, before
the first echo had again resounded upon the still
resonant air.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Listen,&#148; repeated Shibata, his eyes like fireballs in
the dark.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;A thousand answers,&#148; said Gonroku; now, too,
almost convinced.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;You see phantoms, and Sakuma hearkens not to
goblins. Old women and, I believe, some men still
read disaster into the appearance of a fox&mdash;dogs,
badgers, lizards, etc. If Katsutoya really be at
Shizugataka, it is high time that we arrest him. And
if Hideyoshi has been so reckless as to risk a host in
one defense, so much the better for Shibata; the way
shall have been cleared to Kyoto with a single stroke
and&mdash;if I mistake not, Kyoto without Katsutoya
would be quite as acceptable at least to a part of
Kitanoshi as it should be with him&mdash;a phantom.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;What means Sakuma, father?&#148; inquired the son,
perchance more intelligently than judiciously.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Let him take his own proper command, and himself
prove that prophecy is not blasphemy&mdash;by sending
up, to this, a secure place, for you and me, the
head of this &#145;phantom,&#146; as he calls it.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page33" id="page33"></a>[pg&nbsp;33]</span>
&#147;Good,&#148; responded Sakuma&mdash;and division again
strengthened Hideyoshi&#146;s position.</p>
<p class="indent">With calling at Nagahama, Hideyoshi had made
easy the plan of turning an enemy&#146;s ready contingent
into a no less effective than willing instrument.</p>
<p class="indent">Katsutoya had never loved Yodogima, and out of
promotion had conceived the idea also that Shibata,
his benefactor&#146;s purpose, were a hindrance rather than
a help to his vainly imagined restoration. Further,
this particular young princess, according to his nicely
wrought notions, did not at all augur the fulfillment of
an Ashikaga shogun&#146;s well-reputed requirements&mdash;and
Katsutoya&#146;s dreams were already resplendent with
all that had made his supposed ancestors of some
three hundred years tolerable if not respectable.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;The bargain is a just one, Hideyoshi,&#148; promised
he, contemplatively. &#147;Shibata&#146;s daughter would serve
better the necessities of a daimyo like yourself&mdash;Katsutoya
shall have more the need of an humbler service;
take her and welcome; but why risk my neck at
the front? If you would serve me as shogun then
secure me a man.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Just so. And nothing is safer or saner or sounder
than self-made security&mdash;go against this man
Sakuma; the rest are only women, fit to gobble.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Then it is gobble, gobble, and Shizugataka for
me.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Perhaps. You know, though, that Hideyoshi is
reputed, there.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">Katsutoya led his troops to the defense of Shizugataka,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page34" id="page34"></a>[pg&nbsp;34]</span>
Hideyoshi&#146;s outlying stronghold against
Shibata&#146;s well-worn approach; but no sooner had
camp been struck than Sakuma hurled Shibata&#146;s advance
force against him. The battle raged, and
Katsutoya wavered; surprise had overcome him, and
defeat completed the rout. Sakuma would have followed
up his success and gained Yodogima the head,
not the hand, of Katsutoya had not Gonroku hailed
him in the distance; Shibata had again seen the fox&mdash;saw
Hideyoshi&#146;s phalanx scaling the mountains to the
left&mdash;and sent Gonroku to recall Sakuma that he
might make haste to save Kitanoshi itself.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;O Jimmu; O Katsutoya; O Yodogima,&#148; murmured
Shibata, as Gonroku disappeared down the
mountain side.</p>
<p class="indent">A forced march soon brought Gonroku&#146;s reserves
within knowing distance of Sakuma&#146;s victorious division.</p>
<p class="indent">Katsutoya had recovered himself on the opposite
side of Yodo lake. Sakuma grew impatient to take
him, but Gonroku fired at the thought of a hireling&#146;s
success and balked at the proposal, denying even the
identity of their enemy.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;It is Katsutoya, I tell you, and unless destroyed
our very lives are in danger.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;You err, Sakuma; and till you prove me wrong you
shall command no more than a body guard.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">With only six men, seven including himself, Sakuma
plunged through the reeds, once more into the heat
of battle, and the fighting renewed now in desperation;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page35" id="page35"></a>[pg&nbsp;35]</span>
Gonroku looked on with a smile. Valiant men gathered
round and Sakuma spied their bogie hero. Cutting
and slashing his way thither, at last the coveted
thing dropped helpless at a stroke; but lo! was it only
a fox&#146;s head?</p>
<p class="indent">Katsutoya had flown, and the phantom army no
longer a reality Sakuma gathered up the gruesome
thing and hastening thither bowed humbly as tradition
demanded; Gonroku sent him away, to wander
in the woods, as others had done before, a ronin and
a failure&mdash;Hideyoshi thus chanced upon him.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;What have you there, Sakuma?&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">Sakuma hid his face.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Speak, Sakuma; a friend asks it.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">Could this man, a daimyo, so degrade himself as
to speak to an eta (outcast)? His appearance disclosed
the cast, and Hideyoshi had eyes, it was
claimed, in the back of his head. He must answer,
yet dare not utter a word in the presence of a superior;
custom forbade it, and he had just learned a
lesson. No; a subterfuge must serve him: so thinking,
Sakuma dropped his burden, and slunk back out of
sight.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Ha, ha,&#148; muttered Hideyoshi; &#147;a fox&#146;s head&mdash;I&#146;ll
warrant he thought it Katsutoya&#146;s&mdash;reputed son
of a foxier monk than Nobunaga or Christianity
has yet outwitted.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Here, Junkei. Exchange this for the real&mdash;no;
he&#146;s safe, atop Hiyeisan, I&#146;ll warrant; a like one will
do. Understand me?&#148;</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page36" id="page36"></a>[pg&nbsp;36]</span>
&#147;Yes, honorable master.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">The likeness was soon enough returned&mdash;there
were plenty of them in the ranks&mdash;and Sakuma was
again brought in.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Sakuma, you think yourself unfit to address even
me: look at this,&#148; commanded Hideyoshi, holding up
to view the bloodless face.</p>
<p class="indent">Sakuma obeyed; there was no law or privilege that
he knew depriving him of so flagrant a sight. All
the joys of heaven could not have won him more;
it seemed to be the head he really coveted.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;I am your servant,&#148; promised he, and the two of
them bowed respectfully.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Then carry this thing forthwith to Shibata; it
shall be the means no less of his undoing than of
Yodogima&#146;s making&mdash;&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Of Ieyasu&mdash;a plaything.&#148;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>

<p class="indent">Sakuma had served his master and met the foe
as became his better judgment; but an older belief
on the one hand and newer tactics on the other defeated
him.</p>
<p class="indent">The master himself was harrassed with a ruse no
less potent to the southward; Hideyoshi had sent
Niwa&mdash;fired at the promise of spoils&mdash;with only
forty men, to light torches on the mountain side,
and Shibata, overloaded as he was, saw here, too, a
great force: Hideyoshi, hearing of Katsutoya&#146;s defeat
and Shibata&#146;s fears, threw down his chop sticks and
jumping to his feet, exclaimed with joy:</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;I have won. I have won a great victory.&#148; Then
mounting his horse, rode out to battle as became him.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Takiyama, with one-half the army, will move
upon the northern pass: Kuroda, with the other half,
hold against the southern: Hideyoshi, with his staff
and a small body guard, shall make his way, as
best he can, between the two, toward&mdash;Kitanoshi.
Let no temporary success induce either one of you
to venture into the enemy&#146;s territory; Hideyoshi commands.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">The actual presence of these two vast armies drove
consternation finally into the hearts of Shibata&#146;s now
wavering followers. Takiyama cut down Gonroku&#146;s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page38" id="page38"></a>[pg&nbsp;38]</span>
halting force in the north and sent the jealous, vacillating
son himself into the hills a loser and a renegrade.
Kuroda met and dispersed Takigawa and his
relieving army, Shibata&#146;s ally, at the south. Hideyoshi
had met and dispatched Sakuma upon a still
deadlier mission&mdash;Shibata had been routed and, with
only a hundred staid adherents, made his way toward
Kitanoshi, fully resolved upon his course&mdash;but it
remained for another to turn the trick to some purpose
other than ruthless bloodshed alone.</p>
<p class="indent">After parting with Yodogima at Kitanoshi, Ieyasu
had made his way forthwith to castle Fuchu,
his friend Maeda&#146;s estate, in Echizen, near by, with
the settled intention of forming some sort of alliance
that might enable him to take and hold his love,
Yodogima, no matter what the outcome between
Shibata, her father, and Hideyoshi, the usurper.</p>
<p class="indent">Thus when Shibata, too, in his retreat, called there,
to ask the loan of a fresh horse, the two were brought
into direct contact most unexpectedly.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;You are a young man, Ieyasu; and, were I in
your place, I should make peace with Hideyoshi.
For me, it is impossible; I must save the honor of
my house, as our fathers before us have done. Take
heed, my friend.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">Both Ieyasu and Maeda proffered him assistance,
or an escort, but he refused them. The former because
it were too late&mdash;his mind had been made
up&mdash;and as to the latter it might endanger them
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page39" id="page39"></a>[pg&nbsp;39]</span>
and disgrace him were they to be seen leading a
suicide to his mat.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;My family awaits me; it is alone their due and
my privilege, this honored rite. Good-bye.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">Ieyasu fell back, dazed with the intelligence; he
knew that Maeda would keep his word, and that every
member of the household should share his fate. No
descendant of the Taira would be found wanting or
unmindful of the bushido&mdash;Yodogima must be saved,
if at all, by some agency without the pale of his doing
or her understanding.</p>
<p class="indent">He might have overtaken Shibata and defeated
him of his purpose, but that could do no more than
add insult to well-meaning, make it still more incumbent
upon the family, and Yodogima in particular,
tempered as she was, to wipe out the stain accruing.</p>
<p class="indent">Thus puzzled and overcome, the conscious young
lover made the necessary excuses and mounting his
horse rode out into the woods, keeping to bypaths
and unfrequented places, the better to contemplate
some proper course as well his duty. He was disconsolate,
and loitered slowly along, whipping at stray
branches or humming words of recent cheer.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Fain save your song, and guard better the stroke,&#148;
growled a hard-looking outcast, hit and staring behind
the bush at one side.</p>
<p class="indent">Ordinarily Ieyasu should not have minded the
thrust, but something in the voice, though more the
manner of the occasion attracted him.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Come out, my fellow, or I shall cut you down,&#148;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page40" id="page40"></a>[pg&nbsp;40]</span>
threatened he, grasping the hilt of his sword and turning
upon the ruffian, to that one&#146;s very great surprise.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;My clothes are a warning; I am empty, and without
shelter&mdash;yet can serve you,&#148; said the eta, stepping
forth, with a big bundle tied fast at his back.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Ha, ha; etas would serve lords, and lords, their
doom, in these times&mdash;how would you set about
making me happy; Shibata is far away by this time,
villain?&#148; sighed Ieyasu.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Ah-ha-a&mdash;I nearly lost my tongue&mdash;to do that
it would be necessary for you and me to change
places.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;For how long, innocent thing?&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Till Yodogima rights us.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">Ieyasu sprang to the ground; the name of his
love on such lips were more than he could bear without
a vengeance. The occasion for such intelligence
for the moment unnerved him, and no sooner had he
raised sword to strike than his fellow straightened
up, removing a mask, whereat Ieyasu gasped:</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Sakuma!&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Yes; it is he; lend me your horse and I shall do
you the service.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Very well&mdash;but the bundle: what about that?&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Oh, yes; if you like, you may hold it till Shibata
returns; he shall want to see it, and Hideyoshi rightly
trusts me; it&#146;s a good security.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">Ieyasu knew his man and believed him true; hence
carefully closed the sack and himself tied up the end&mdash;it
seemed a gruesome task, but Yodogima were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page41" id="page41"></a>[pg&nbsp;41]</span>
worth any price imposed; so he shouldered the bag
and once again made his way toward his friend,
Maeda&#146;s house, for were his accomplice successful at
informing Shibata, and could the determined father
but see that face once more, there remained no doubt
in his mind as to what the outcome should be.</p>
<p class="indent">Nor was Hideyoshi any the less advised, or conscious,
or alert, as to probable results; in the absence
of Ieyasu he had run in upon Maeda&mdash;also his
friend&mdash;knocking hard upon the door with his cutlass
and calling out:</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Mataza, Mataza!&#148; (Maeda&#146;s given name.)</p>
<p class="indent">Maeda welcomed him, and as they stood chatting
about an alliance, wherefore especially the visitor had
called, Ieyasu came trudging in.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;What unsightly thing have you there, Ieyasu?&#148;
inquired the host, withal reassuringly, if somewhat
suspiciously, considering the identity of their newest
guest.</p>
<p class="indent">Ieyasu carefully set the bundle upon a convenient
bench, and would of his own will, under the circumstances,
have made short work of Hideyoshi had not
the offence been unpardonable to any host, much more
so with Maeda, whom they both respected as well as
courted.</p>
<p class="indent">Hideyoshi appeared to be not at all disturbed,
though he scanned carefully the bag and may have
remembered seeing it before, and as much as fairly
guessed its contents.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;A fox, I reckon,&#148; ventured Hideyoshi, by way of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page42" id="page42"></a>[pg&nbsp;42]</span>
compromise; &#147;they are plentiful in these parts, so I
am told. Where did you get it, Ieyasu, and is it a
whole one, or only the head? Come; out with it, and
I&#146;ll stand sponsor.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">Ieyasu would fight, if needs be, but could not bear
an insult, particularly at the hands of this so-called
monkey-faced upstart&mdash;though he had just routed
Shibata and now bade fair to win over their mutual
friend Maeda.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Come closer,&#148; said Ieyasu, &#147;if you would really
know the contents of this significant little bag; I may
not soon again have such pleasure.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;My sword, if you like, Ieyasu.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;No, thanks; you may yourself have need to use it.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Upon my word; you don&#146;t mean to infer the
thing&#146;s alive?&#148; suggested Maeda, a little nervous.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Look,&#148; demanded Ieyasu, apparently somewhat
angered.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;As I said; but what did you do with its body; I
see only the face?&#148; retorted Hideyoshi.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;What is it, Maeda?&#148; inquired Ieyasu, a bit perturbed.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;A fox!&#148; stammered the host, fairly white in the
face.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;It&#146;s a trick, I&#146;ll promise,&#148; ventured Ieyasu, no
longer doubtful of Hideyoshi&#146;s motive&mdash;or powers.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Then let us turn it to some good use; friends
have no better guarantee than constancy; I&#146;ll carry it
back, to where you got it, and see it&#146;s done; wrangling
widens only the gulf it would span; the circle is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page43" id="page43"></a>[pg&nbsp;43]</span>
but a square not wholly produced,&#148; said Hideyoshi,
fully conscious of Ieyasu&#146;s master intention.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Silly twaddle, for serious men,&#148; muttered Maeda,
upon parting and going each his way, as solemnly if
doubtfully pledged.</p>
<p class="indent">The flames were yet raging when Hideyoshi reached
the outskirts of Kitinoshi; Shibata had sooner entered
the city, and lest any part of his treasured place should
escape expurgation the sorely beaten and vainly tried
daimyo began resolutely to apply the torch upon passing
the outer ramparts, and did not cease until the
fire had spread in every direction. Inside the palace
all was confusion. His intimate friends had gathered
in a last sad attempt to console a dying chieftain.
For a lifetime they had served him and his and now
that the time had come they would do him honor in
death.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;It is the will of Kami (God),&#148; said he, &#147;that I am
defeated. Do you serve me yet?&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Yes,&#148; they all cried, eagerly.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Then it is meet that I do something to show my
appreciation of such loyalty. Let a feast be spread
and the sake brought in and music provided that we
make merry, for to-morrow we shall be&mdash;dead.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">The flames roared and raged without, and they
sang and danced and composed until a late hour. Not
a soul there would but suffer the torments of hades
to quench the thirst for chivalry&mdash;they should have
died a thousand times to die an honorable death, to go
peacefully to rest in the embrace of a master&#146;s rite.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page44" id="page44"></a>[pg&nbsp;44]</span>
Presently the fires burned low on the outside, and
the spirit increased correspondingly within; the sake
cup was passed round, each taking his final leave.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Asai, my good wife,&#148; inquired Shibata, &#147;will you
not go from the castle? Hideyoshi will not harm
you, a daughter of Nobunaga.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Why in the flesh, if the spirit rebels? I am yours
in death as I have been in life. Do not turn me from
you: let me die with you,&#148; begged she, bowing low
down, on the mat before him.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;What greater joy could heaven contain?&#148; responded
he, wholly absorbed.</p>
<p class="indent">Then a fox vainly leaped among them, and Shibata
stared hard past Yodogima&mdash;a head stood
perched upon a faggot at her back.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Cannot you see them? Two&mdash;one on either side,
reaching farther than Fuchu&mdash;Sakuma weeps: Katsutoya
laughs&mdash;Yodogima!&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Yes, father.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Do you not&mdash;help me?&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;I had thought to let&mdash;but some strange thing
seems to possess us.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;What is it, daughter?&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">Yodogima hesitated.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;You have eyes?&#148; suggested he.</p>
<p class="indent">Her heart throbbed painfully.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;You would not deny me?&#148; plead her father.</p>
<p class="indent">The blood rushed into her face; and Katsutoya
laughed outright: Shibata tremblingly urged:</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Speak, daughter.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page45" id="page45"></a>[pg&nbsp;45]</span>
The one pleading, the other taunting, drove hard the
will, yet thought rebelled, and Yodogima&#146;s face turned
rigid. Peace had been his and faithfulness her own
had not this, the bitterest test of living, come at last
to stay the hand of death. She might have evaded
him, but the very thing she sought forbade it. He
must dishonor her were the truth known. She had
sinned, and tradition proffered not repentance. What
was it, then, that moved Yodogima to answer as she
did? Some subtle influence had wrought her father&#146;s
decline; they were then contemplating together the
virtue of an only salvation, and&mdash;Yodogima, too,
saw a face: it beckoned: she answered:</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Ieyasu!&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;He? The maker of our destiny?&#148; demanded
Shibata.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Yes. My lover.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;How so, Yodogima; you had not mentioned this?&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;You denied me the privilege&mdash;as you imagine me
now.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Ah, ha&mdash;you would mock really a parent? Then
go from me; and learn what it is to desecrate the
gods. And that you may drink to the dregs, I send
your two sisters along to do you service thereat. No
daughter of mine shall disgrace me in death&mdash;be
gone!&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">The fires were then lighted in the rooms all around
them. Shibata and Asai, his wife and only hope,
withdrew into an inner chamber. The floors had been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page46" id="page46"></a>[pg&nbsp;46]</span>
covered with straw, and the flames leaped up&mdash;Yodogima
turned to go, and two faces, one hideous, the
other smiling, greeted her.</p>
<p class="indent">A cross and an image bore they&mdash;thence duty
called her; the purpose stood revealed.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page47" id="page47"></a>[pg&nbsp;47]</span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<p class="indent">With her eyes thus opened, mysticism disappeared:
the elements crackled, and out of
consciousness there arose a determination to survive
any test that might be imposed. All her tender life
had been surrendered faithfully and uncompromisingly
to the harsher edicts of conventional man; and
stern realism had bidden her renounce every impulse;
there had seemed no alternative to save honor&mdash;the
gods demanded it, the family claimed it, and self had
not dared deny death its sole reward.</p>
<p class="indent">Then, as womanhood arrived, barely kissed fain
consciousness, in one stolen rapport, just an unguarded
moment, the godlight once shone in, had
seized upon her, made it seem as if there was a
heaven, as if God himself had touched her very soul
and the blessed come to earth&mdash;a little thing as
insignificant as any worm or bird or animal, only a
fox, had come between her and what she might have
had for the taking; and that, too, without disturbing
as she believed her father&#146;s plans in the least or suffering
the pain of being left in the world to do
penance for a thing that she knew to be wholly beyond
the reach or concern of her own insignificant little
self.</p>
<p class="indent">Yodogima had been cast out, degraded, and left to
makeshift, but not defeated. In that one moment of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page48" id="page48"></a>[pg&nbsp;48]</span>
utter helplessness she had resolved to meet the world
as found, and to make of life what God intended&mdash;an
abiding faith in that we know and not a conjured
reach toward something fancied.</p>
<p class="indent">Ieyasu had promised her protection&mdash;his love he
had given her&mdash;and she believed him capable and
true; that she had renounced Katsutoya and accepted
Ieyasu rightly, though against every obligation that
she knew developments had proven beyond peradventure.
Her father had anticipated an impossibility,
asked her to stultify every moral consideration on her
part to gratify an ambition of his, that proved at the
first test to be utterly groundless and without the
shadow of a compensating hope. Accident or will
had denied her the privilege of an explanation; fate
alone, for all she knew, had interposed to lay bare
the secret of her heart at an inopportune moment,
and a fancied code had sought to crush her beneath
its ruthless dictum at a time when the very heart-chords
of repentance called loudest for pleasing atonement.</p>
<p class="indent">It seemed as if the same god who had torn her
therefrom must save her unto himself; and her heart
bled for him alone.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Ieyasu,&#148; cried she, more confident than ever.</p>
<p class="indent">Her voice seemed to die close underneath the angry
elements; but quickly&mdash;all this had crowded upon
her instantly&mdash;strong arms, others than she had allowed,
gathered her up, together with her two sisters,
younger than she, and placing them in chairs made
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page49" id="page49"></a>[pg&nbsp;49]</span>
their way through the charred, falling remnants of all
that had been so dear to her, toward the woodland,
not far distant, to the southward.</p>
<p class="indent">The glare of the lights and the lamentations of the
populace startled her, and she would have turned if
only in some small way to their relief, but the bettos
(carriers) ran on, heeding neither her pleadings nor
their own safety so long as they might serve&mdash;their
employer, Sakuma, who led the way.</p>
<p class="indent">They had gone some distance and almost beyond
danger from the burning city before Yodogima had
discovered him or knew who it was that planned and
directed her flight. It gave her confidence, and she
did not call out lest her interference might disturb
him; nor did she fear thereafter the course they took,
though it seemed a strange direction and an ominous
exit&mdash;there was one, lurking behind, however, following
their every movement, dodging from corner to
corner and street to street, who knew better than she
just what to expect and where to intercept them.</p>
<p class="indent">All these doings were as a blank to Yodogima,
whose only thought now was of Ieyasu. That soon
she should reach him, was at that very moment on her
way thither, and that he, strong and virile, should
make due atonement for this, that she had suffered,
would forthwith claim her as his own, and after all
make life worth the living was the sole consciousness
that bore her onward. Duplicity, with its cold, futile
aims, as barren in the end as Ieyasu&#146;s waiting might
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page50" id="page50"></a>[pg&nbsp;50]</span>
prove disastrous, were a thing wholly beyond her
knowledge or comprehension.</p>
<p class="indent">They had not gone far into the woods, however,
till the confiding princess had good reason to witness,
if not apprehend, something of the clashing motives
that underlay her further progress. Sakuma had led
them to the right, toward the thick of the forest, and
Yodogima&#146;s pulse then began to slacken and her
throat filled and choked her; she knew that Ieyasu&#146;s
domain lay to the left, over the mountains, through
Mino, in the southward, and supposed him there, as
reason would dictate. They were now travelling
northerly, into the west, where Hideyoshi might be
expected to be found scouting or encamped: it grew
dark and difficult of going: Yodogima wondered and
conjectured, till fear seized hard upon her.</p>
<p class="indent">Presently the bettos halted, and resting the poles
upon their staffs breathed heavily, the while speculating
among themselves as to their further task.
These fellows, then, did not know where they were
to go, and the probabilities multiplied in Yodogima&#146;s
mind.</p>
<p class="indent">Sakuma had gone on, into the dark, as if in search
of an outlet; then a sudden whipping and snapping
of twigs, at one side, distinctly heard only by Yodogima,
apprised her of the swift running of someone,
apparently past them and after Sakuma. Directly a
low gurgling, and hard thud upon the ground startled
her once more into bare apprehension.</p>
<p class="indent">Yodogima uttered not a word, but listened; the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page51" id="page51"></a>[pg&nbsp;51]</span>
bettos talked on; no other sound reached her ears;
then the brush rattled, and it occurred to her that
somebody&#146;s clothing had been changed; she waited;
a man tramped along, not close enough to be scrutinized,
but within hearing distance&mdash;whose outline
appeared a trifle taller than Sakuma&mdash;till directly
opposite, when he commanded the bettos to change
their course and follow him.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page52" id="page52"></a>[pg&nbsp;52]</span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<p class="indent">They had gone back into the open, turning again
toward a course to the southward; bearing a
little to the west, along the well-travelled roadway
that led directly into the main pass over the mountains
through Mino, for Mikawa, Ieyasu&#146;s domain;
where stood Okazaki castle, his birthplace and inherited
fortress. To this place, enchanted as it now
seemed to her, Yodogima would have gone a willing
slave to its master&#146;s caprice and otherwise still a devoted
helpmeet in the rendering of an established
and expansive, if cruelly submissive order.</p>
<p class="indent">It was yet dark, but the bettos pattered along at a
lively gait; a trifling advance promised in their wage
had allayed any misgivings that they might have had
as to a possible change of leaders; and glad, moreover,
of the less burdensome or hazardous going now
confronting them, their progress became as rapid as
the escape seemed propitious.</p>
<p class="indent">The way lay through a richly cultivated and thickly
inhabited valley, bespeaking a prosperous and friendly
environment. Yet it was dark, and these things were
not discernible&mdash;no lingering light shone forth, nor
belated dweller accidentally peered&mdash;save for an
occasional howling round some dismal corner, or the
hard, smooth-worn curbstone&#146;s welcome reply. Yodogima
leaned restfully back in the chair; Jokoin, her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page53" id="page53"></a>[pg&nbsp;53]</span>
youngest sister, yet innocent and fair, had gone to
sleep, contentedly: only Esyo, next older, with cold,
penetrating look, and rigid, exacting manner, sat upright,
wrangling with this one or that the probable
outcome of such daring do.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;You are a winsome, headstrong thing,&#148; threatened
she, of Yodogima, as their chairs came close together,
in a broadened stretch of road, where the bettos were
wont to gossip in venturesome consultation about a
possible rest. &#147;Only for you, I might have been permitted&mdash;as
any true daughter should be&mdash;a more
logical, if not less unbecoming, situation. Here it is,
dead of night; and Shibata, a lord daimyo&#146;s whole
bevy most uncomfortably trudging through goodness
knows what; and all to no purpose, I am sure.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Be quiet, Esyo,&#148; commanded Yodogima, not the
least bit impatient; &#147;you shall soon enough find it
convenient, if not agreeable, to discuss till content
some of the urgencies: the proprieties had best take
care of themselves&mdash;for the present, it would appear,
to your faithful, if unworthy, sister.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Who said that you are unworthy? Come, Yodogima;
don&#146;t be unreasonable.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Please do not get excited.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;I am not excited, I tell you; and had you my
temper you should not have fallen in love with that
Ieyasu; nor would you have so forgotten yourself
as to wholly disregard better discretion by clinging to
him&mdash;why didn&#146;t you tell father it was a myth, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page54" id="page54"></a>[pg&nbsp;54]</span>
face a mysticism, and his decision most unreasonably
mystifying&mdash;&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Oh, sister; how you talk; in that case you shouldn&#146;t
have been here, or anywhere; and, Ieyasu is very
real.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Quite like all the rest: a pack of them&mdash;all of
them, every one like the other.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;And I am not so sure but Esyo, herself, might
prove to be the best quarry among us: take care that
you do not give me further cause, to suspect as much;
more I dare not.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">They had travelled a long time, it seemed months
to Yodogima, when, without warning, in the dawning
light, their leader, with uncovered face, thrust his
head into Yodogima&#146;s presence, cautioning her:</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Trust me, Yodogima; I have given proper instructions
to the bettos; I must now leave you.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">Yodogima drew back with alarm, too frightened to
make answer or to comprehend him; it was Katsutoya
she recognized.</p>
<p class="indent">Thus leaving his charge to fare as best they might,
under the instructions given, Katsutoya sped on, into
the distance, purposing to reach and advise Ieyasu
if possible of what he had done toward saving Yodogima
from the clutches of Hideyoshi; who in parting
with Ieyasu had done as promised: returned the
bundle to where Ieyasu had found it. Sakuma,
however, did not reappear as expected; instead there
came another, also disguised; and equally taken aback,
as well as penetrating, both Hideyoshi and Katsutoya
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page55" id="page55"></a>[pg&nbsp;55]</span>
for once blundered expediency to gain some sort of
intended advantage.</p>
<p class="indent">Katsutoya, therefore, and not Sakuma, had saved
the princess, and with all his energies now sought to
advise Ieyasu, in whose service he believed he would
fare safer and welcome. It proved to be a long and
a hard run to Fuchu, where Ieyasu yet remained,
waiting. Squads of Hideyoshi&#146;s troops and scouts
already infested the country, and the by-ways and
brush-covered hills proved hard of traversing, yet
Katsutoya faithfully and hopefully pressed on, reaching
his destination exhausted and sore.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;What brings you here, and at this time?&#148; inquired
Ieyasu, coldly; when confronted by the messenger,
eager and positive.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;I would do you a service, though I am but an outcast,
as you see,&#148; replied Katsutoya, earnestly.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;As others have done&mdash;more discreetly. Go. I
have no confidence in pretence. Ieyasu shall, hereafter,
select his own assistants. Sakuma, at least,
taught me a lesson.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;And Katsutoya shall teach you a better one,
though you do refuse me. Hideyoshi shall have
hunted out and claimed your Yodogima long before
Ieyasu has made up his mind to do more than wait.
And to show you that Katsutoya is your friend and
not a rival, as you have it, I lend you my disguise,
that you may find a way home; there to pander to
jealousy and defend your life. Greatness lies rather
in aggressiveness. Good-day, sir.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page56" id="page56"></a>[pg&nbsp;56]</span>
So saying, Katsutoya disappeared, before the astonished
Ieyasu had fairly recovered his breath. Those
words, however, burned deeply into his consciousness,
and he would have run after his supposed rival had
he dared venture, undisguised, beyond the confines
of his friend Maeda&#146;s protection.</p>
<p class="indent">Ieyasu knew only too well that he had been tricked
by Hideyoshi; that his recent bravado and promised
alliance had been feigned for immediate effect; that
his troops were at that very moment scouring the
country, he himself fully believed without even a
suggestion from Katsutoya or anyone else; that his
own neck were in danger he was wholly aware&mdash;from
political motives, however, and not as a result
of any clashing of love interests; in his dull mind,
Hideyoshi had no more thought of taking a defeated
daimyo&#146;s daughter to himself than Katsutoya had of
befriending a successful rival. His household seemed
already full enough.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Hideyoshi in love, and a wife and some three
hundred, now? Bosh!&#148; muttered he, to himself,
though donning the disguise and preparing for flight.
&#147;Thanks, however, to Hideyoshi&#146;s cleverness, we
shall see no more of Katsutoya, vain wretch&mdash;Yodogima
is still alive; he just as well as said so, and the
gods shall see that Ieyasu gets his due. I can wait,
yet go I must.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">Ieyasu set out unattended and forlorn; while the
bettos were landing Yodogima, hopeful if not happy,
at an appointed tea-house in the rugged mountains
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page57" id="page57"></a>[pg&nbsp;57]</span>
capping an upper arm of the valley through which
they had climbed. Here, Katsutoya had directed her
to remain; it was secluded, and not far distant from
the main highway over which her lover must make
his exit, through the otherwise almost impassable
range.</p>
<p class="indent">It had grown warmer with the rising sun and a
sheltered environment, yet Yodogima waxed the more
eager and became less tolerant. She knew the locality
well enough, but somehow could not bring herself to
believe Katsutoya bent upon anything but downright
betrayal. They were sitting in the open, at the rear
of a large room, on the second floor, overlooking
a deep gorge below and the broad valley farther on
in the distance. Jokoin chafed under the restraint,
and Esyo scolded.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;I can see no harm in going below, and into a
public room&mdash;we are daughters of Shibata, and there
is a man down there; I hear his voice.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Jokoin! What is to be done with you? We are
alone, and outcasts&mdash;&#148; began Esyo, half intended for
Yodogima.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;The more the need of cultivating someone&#146;s friendship,&#148;
retorted Jokoin.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;But we have no means of an introduction, and
do not know that it is a gentleman.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Let us forget form: I hear a sword rattling.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">Yodogima made neither protest nor comment; she
was content to let Esyo wrestle it out with Jokoin,
whose good sense she believed quite the better of her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page58" id="page58"></a>[pg&nbsp;58]</span>
indiscretion. Therefore, when Jokoin finally led down
the stairs, with Esyo close after, their eldest sister,
sitting back upon the soft-matted floor, turned her
thoughts far away, and to things beyond the staid
comprehension of the one or above the emotional
reach of the other.</p>
<p class="indent">All these things around her, men and women had
called real; but to her they seemed very unreal. She
had been brought into the world and set down among
them without a voice or a hand in the making. Reality,
this? Far from it. Why, the very food they ate
was not what it seemed, the roof overhead but a
creation, and for all she knew her own clothing might
be the merest makeshift as against a real, a truly penetrating
eye. These, then, were but resulting products,
and of what? Ideality?</p>
<p class="indent">Her own soul cried aloud for something better,
purer, and more certain than all these sordid trappings
of man&#146;s little endeavor. There must be an
ethereal, a state transfixed&mdash;of earth, but infinite&mdash;and
could she only resolve its quantity the elements
had afforded a way; the sun, the moon, the stars, the
earth and all that there is upon it were but the atoms
of an endless progression, fixed and apportioned by
the same compelling, abiding agency that had touched
her and bound her when confronted with a natural
and unhindered attraction.</p>
<p class="indent">The mountain-top hung high above: she wanted to
get there, to some place far away from vulgar witnessing,
and there seek communion with the spirit
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page59" id="page59"></a>[pg&nbsp;59]</span>
that seemed so near yet nowhere within reach. Man
had brought forth nothing not deceptive, failed utterly
of conception&mdash;a province wholly within the grasp
of woman, the more her reason.</p>
<p class="indent">Having at last resolved to press the quest alone
and untrammelled, Yodogima ran out and along the
narrow veranda to the long, smooth-worn steps that
wound up and around the mountain-side to its summit
in the background. The climb was not a hard
one, and as she went she remarked the usefulness
to which the hand of man really had been put. Yet
there seemed a want of guidance, and upon arriving
at a deserted temple the poverty of his understanding
became the more painfully apparent.</p>
<p class="indent">History recorded ages and cycles of crowding and
striving and yet how much had been done to show that
anything more than nature had inhabited this earth?
A few houses, here and there a crooked, stumbling
highway, now and then a ship at sea, all temporary,
and so little of beauty! Really it seemed a pity that
so much good rich blood and vain high sounding
words had been expended upon nothing more than
barely living: then, approaching the summit, nearer
and nearer, his track or touch began to disappear,
presently became extinct, and no such delight had
entered her heart, save once before. Heaven, limitless
and real, encouraging the utmost within her,
seemed a thing of consequence; and the earth receding
and vanishing and lost, with its humdrum and
vanity but an atom engulfed, were as if a memory-disappearing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page60" id="page60"></a>[pg&nbsp;60]</span>
and forgotten over against the invisible
grind of a molten, seething yesterday.</p>
<p class="indent">Sitting down upon a clean-washed, sun-dried and
nature-fashioned rock, there waiting&mdash;no vulgar
thing or mad intellect had touched it&mdash;Yodogima
looked all around, then fastened her eyes upon a
blushing bluebell that tenderly upturned its sweetened
lips in token of the message she sought. A
cuckoo flew also there, perching itself in defiance:
Yodogima whispered:</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Sing to me.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">The bird listed mute and wanting.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;I&#146;ll help the cuckoo to sing,&#148; replied she, vouchsafing
to waft her melodies on the light, over-sounding
air.</p>
<p class="indent">The little thing answered her, only as it could&mdash;but
out of its song there arose the voice of&mdash;</p>
<p class="indent">The bush rattled at her back, and springing to her
feet, and turning quickly round, Yodogima shrieked:</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Hideyoshi!&#148;</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page61" id="page61"></a>[pg&nbsp;61]</span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<p class="indent">&#147;Yes; it is he&mdash;and you need not start at my
presence. I hear that I am, by some, called
vulgar; by many, said to be cruel; I know only that I
am human: that the touch of your garment would
rouse in ordinary man a passion fiercer than the
flames: that I myself would make you queen; yet
you are as safe from harm in my possession as he&mdash;the
man you just now fancied more than manly&mdash;is
impotent to render in the least a real consolation or
a substantial aid. That you may realize fully that I
am true and not false, I tender you the only instrument
that ever made or unmade god or man. Do
with it and with me as you like; you are both strong
of arm and quick to see,&#148; urged Hideyoshi, approaching
and tendering with much reverence the hilt of his
unsheathed, if vain, resolver of ethics.</p>
<p class="indent">Yodogima frowned. All the womanhood within her
revolted at such boasted display of wanton cowardice.
That man never is right till might has made him so,
she could well believe; that might is right in the eyes
of the gods were as incomprehensible to her as it
seemed satisfying to him.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Look me in the face,&#148; demanded she, without lifting
a foot.</p>
<p class="indent">Hideyoshi colored, and bowed only the lower: his
eyes shifted about reluctantly, and useless.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page62" id="page62"></a>[pg&nbsp;62]</span>
&#147;Shame!&#148; threatened she, advancing a step.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;I am advised of no better means than&mdash;&#148; began
Hideyoshi, cold with suspense.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;A bluff? How often have you practiced this sort
of ennui upon others, perhaps more tolerant? I
would set a better example,&#148; interposed Yodogima,
snapping his weapon against the ground and casting
the fragments away.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Well done,&#148; promised he, recovering somewhat
his composure. &#147;But haven&#146;t you oversaid yourself,
a bit? The tables turned, however, may be more
becoming; I can prove my valor: a broken heart is
less easily mended. I need not suggest, of course,
that you yourself might name&mdash;the terms?&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;No, no,&#148; gasped Yodogima, as the possible fate of
Ieyasu flashed into mind.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Then it is really quite unnecessary to arrange it&mdash;yet
I had sooner meet a worthy man than fall begging
of a pretty woman. Come; I shall take you whether
you will or not, with or without the means, before or
after the test, temptation or provocation. Let us be
off, to Azuchi, where the muses hold their tongues
and order wins fairly the heart.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Captivity implies compulsion&mdash;in some instances;
but our lord&#146;s behavior convinces me that I might
have fallen into less&mdash;considerate hands.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">Hideyoshi led the way down along the winding
incline and back into the very place which she had
but a short hour thence deserted; in a more hopeful,
if less certain, mood. The same walls enclosed the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page63" id="page63"></a>[pg&nbsp;63]</span>
front and sides, the outlet at the rear had not changed
at all; humanity seemed continuing its blind rush
toward an ideal bolstered with ten thousand times
ten thousand conjured notions: the breath of ages
smelled as sweet and wholesome as it did before she
had quitted there and gone to the mountain&#146;s crest:
her heart beat as warmly for her own chosen lord as
ever; but something within, a silent mover of the
senses and regulator of the mind, told her that were
that love to ripen and shed its fruit something better
than waiting and a thing more potent than might must
intervene to stay the hand of probability&mdash;and together
with consciousness came the sting.</p>
<p class="indent">Then the will arose, calling loudly upon the often
fickle, but now most worthy, God of Constancy to lead
her truly and deliver her aright unto the man she believed
incapable of design; much more, fully competent
to make the rescue.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;I do love you&mdash;I know it now&mdash;O Ieyasu&mdash;my
love, my faith, my hope.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">The men and trappings rattled and tramped on the
outside; preparations were making for the march, and
Hideyoshi now more than ever scolded the lines and
spruced his bearing. The fortunes of war had made
him master of central Japan, had given him the capital
and placed him in possession of the emperor, but
the wiles of a woman taxed more heavily his energies.</p>
<p class="indent">Whether to overawe with guards and poltroonery
or to encourage by liberties granted and confidences
bestowed, were to him, now, under the circumstances,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page64" id="page64"></a>[pg&nbsp;64]</span>
and in this case, quite as vital a matter as had been in
ordinary times the choice between tweedledee and
tweedledum.</p>
<p class="indent">The princess, herself, had made light of his own
puerile methods; he had purposely refrained from
demanding, as was the custom, the head of his old-time
rival, Shibata, her father, solely in the hope of
soothing and inspiring her: had he failed also in that?
Ieyasu had been allowed to escape, that terror should
not drive his coveted love to a last extremity; but
seemingly all his plans had miscarried, placing him
now at the brink of a still more vital blunder&mdash;and
win he would: if unfairly, none the less manly, for
that.</p>
<p class="indent">Her two sisters had disappeared&mdash;Takiyama had
laid siege to the one, and the other scolded the way
along to keep her company and see that Hideyoshi&#146;s
second best general proved a diligent escort.</p>
<p class="indent">The roads were smooth, withal their crookedness
and the rugged aspect of the country through which
they entered to pass. An occasional rabbit jumped
away, into the thicket, none the wiser for a strange,
harmless fright, and Yodogima marvelled the dextrousness
of his small endeavor. Could she likewise
defeat or escape harm? No; civilization had reduced
her to less agile and more hardened methods. And
for what? They had gone into a thickened cluster
of stragglingly growing pines with drooping, needle-laden
branches and no dry leaves or fallen limbs to
rattle and crackle underneath. It was now getting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page65" id="page65"></a>[pg&nbsp;65]</span>
dark again, and the probabilities of the occasion
caused her to peer and listen with more than ordinary
anxiety, yet no spook had ever roused in her so much
as a possible thought.</p>
<p class="indent">The advance had gone on, rapidly, and were by this
time far in the lead. Hideyoshi had remained well
behind, bringing up the rear and keeping the whole
under observation with as little inconvenience or
damage as likely; as he was wont to do under all circumstances
and in much less trying situations than
this, the proudest homecoming in his hard, eventful
career. That part of the cavalcade in which Yodogima&#146;s
chair constituted the principal charge had
strung out along the roadstead in single file, and as
there seemed no possible chance for escape in either
direction the guards sang their way along in front or
lagged behind in contemplation of the uncertainties
foreshadowing a visit with their mothers or sweethearts
at home.</p>
<p class="indent">Directly they had reached the darkest place, rounding
a sharp curve, the princess leaned forward, staring
vacantly into an ominous opening, covered and
narrow, through the limbs and brush, at the lower
side of the roadway. The same bettos that rescued
her from the conflagration at Kitanoshi had been at
her especial solicitation grudgingly retained for her
further use upon this particular part of the renewed
journey. They knew full well the reason&mdash;Yodogima
slid carefully down from the chair and as cautiously
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page66" id="page66"></a>[pg&nbsp;66]</span>
entered the gloomy place on which her eyes
had all but riveted.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Yodogima?&#148; whispered a voice, that quickly set
at rest her anxiously pulsating self, as to what it was
and who it were so subtlely attracting her attention.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Yes, Ieyasu&mdash;but you must not be discovered
here. Let me go, and save yourself. The escape
you propose would ill afford either of us the relief
sought.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Can you trust me, Yodogima?&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;I do.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Then go; and, depend upon it, I shall recover you;
your good sense convinces me of an abiding sincerity.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">Ieyasu again slunk off into the wilderness, and
Yodogima, his love pledged anew, softly climbed
back into the chair, without so much as attracting a
concerned witness. To constancy there had been
added assurance, and thence the heart waxed light
and the mind clear&mdash;the will had sooner halted at no
bounds.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;He shall have me, and I will know no other; poor,
weak, insignificant woman that I am,&#148; resolved she,
as the bettos at first slowly, then more rapidly,
stretched forward to recover the small ground lost.</p>
<p class="indent">At Azuchi, to Yodogima&#146;s surprise&mdash;agreeable as
it was&mdash;and Hideyoshi&#146;s chagrin, there developed at
once much confusion and not a little bickering. Most
of the three hundred or thereabout female court and
household attendants already there took the matter
of an additional three, though respectively young and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page67" id="page67"></a>[pg&nbsp;67]</span>
knowing and pretty, with something of indifference;
arrayed against curiosity, of course; but there happened
to be one among them, the lord daimyo&#146;s lawful
wife and always best helpmeet, Oyea, who looked
upon the introduction of three such princesses&mdash;whose
character and former standing she had had,
already, abundant opportunity as well as occasion to
know and understand&mdash;with something more than
ordinary concern if not outright suspicion.</p>
<p class="indent">This Oyea happened to be, as she herself well
knew, the second wife of the rapidly rising Hideyoshi;
the first one had been set aside early for no
other reason than personal felicitation; and though
Oyea had proven constantly his best adviser as well
as most companionable personage she now held, perhaps
not altogether without cause, some reasonable
doubt about the future. Her husband had won his
spurs, such as they were, with no other appreciable
aid than her own good counsel, and now stood in a
position to do pretty much as he pleased, political or
otherwise, especially socially. His lordship was getting
more restless, seeking new fields to conquer. She
judged him rightly; had failed to render him an heir;
and was she really, after all, to lose him, or his love?</p>
<p class="indent">Neither Jokoin nor Esyo caused her so much as a
heart pang; the one frivolous, the other intrusive,
could be of no other use to her husband than to serve
some political necessity or trading convenience&mdash;in
fact were forthwith adopted by him for those express
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page68" id="page68"></a>[pg&nbsp;68]</span>
purposes. But Yodogima! Here came a victim who
stood in the light of a possible intruder.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Take her away,&#148; commanded Oyea, understanding
her liege lord from the beginning and deigning to set
her foot down only as she knew how and why.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;You wouldn&#146;t have me turn the princess, Shibata&#146;s
daughter, out, would you? Come; let us be more
charitable; the reason need not deter you, in the
least; Oyea denies not to others traits she herself most
admires.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">The princess, finally admitted, upon terms&mdash;thanks
to Oyea&mdash;more pleasing to her than satisfying to the
would-be traducer, had gained from their parley more
than a knowledge of just what to expect and how best
to demean herself; she had not only won with modesty
the friendship of his wife but thenceforth knew better
than any other the weakest spot in Hideyoshi&#146;s hitherto
unreadable make-up. Here at least the great
daimyo had really halted in the enforcement of his
will. No man had yet checked or escaped him in his
onward rush toward the goal of an ardent ambition,
but one woman, and that, too, his wife, had called a
halt upon desire; perhaps a far more difficult thing
of controlling than any mere mental trait. Oyea had
temporarily interceded, though, without any other
hold than mentality; why not herself, if she must,
master him; having at least something more potent,
with which to begin?</p>
<p class="indent">Nor had she long to wait for an opportunity to pit
herself against him: as well, her sister Esyo. In
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page69" id="page69"></a>[pg&nbsp;69]</span>
the final allotment of stations in the household, Jokoin
and Esyo had been assigned quarters and allowed service
befitting a younger and an elder daughter; but
Yodogima fared in some respects better: in fact, was
at once provided with attendance more elaborate and
attention no less sumptuous than it had been theretofore
the good wife&#146;s privilege to enjoy.</p>
<p class="indent">Oyea knew only too well what this meant in reality;
but she had also measured the limit of her influence
and sought by compromise to ease the burden of
having ultimately to bear both the chagrin and the
sorrow of tolerating under one and the same roof
the fruits of a regularly established first-in-rank concubine.</p>
<p class="indent">She had made no mistake in Yodogima, however,
and surmised from the first that would Hideyoshi
succeed he must not only hold his own against outside
influences but should find it necessary to combat not
any the less at home the combined energies of two
heads, both feminine and bent upon a common purpose.</p>
<p class="indent">Esyo reasoned differently. She was cold and negative
by nature. Jokoin had gathered round herself
all the available chivalry at the castle, leaving her
less ardent sister to worry and resolve rather a more
studied diversion. And jealousy soon developed an
opportunity. She wrought accordingly.</p>
<p class="indent">Thus ensconced in time as satisfactorily as possible
under the circumstances, Hideyoshi thought it best
to let the women wrangle out among themselves the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page70" id="page70"></a>[pg&nbsp;70]</span>
ordinarily necessary little adjustments of so vital a
beginning; hence, without much ado, and little encroachment
upon the liberties or patience of Yodogima,
set off toward Ozaka fully determined upon
providing the young princess with a place and environment
all her own. This important old fortress city&mdash;wrested
in former years by Nobunaga from the turbulent
monks&mdash;not only occupied one of the strongest
natural sites for offensive and defensive purposes but
offered as well some most advantageous prospects for
residential beautification and enjoyment. The property
already fallen into his hands, Hideyoshi forthwith
gave instructions for the building of a castle that
should outstrip anything of a like kind theretofore
attempted.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;I mean to do this for Yodogima, and for her
alone,&#148; said he, to Oyea, who called him to task for
such intended prodigality, &#147;in consideration of the
benefits bestowed upon me by her dear father in the
performance of harakiri (suicide). You need have
no fears, nor she any misgivings.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">The men were set at work, and Esyo began planning;
she could not bear the slight, yet knew that her
only prospect lay in Ieyasu.</p>
<p class="indent">Dispatching forthwith a message (duly intercepted,
of course) in which all of the facts were related with
as much imagination as she could bring to bear upon
the subject, Esyo deliberately set herself the task of
undoing all that Yodogima had suffered to accomplish.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Depend upon what I say, she has no thought or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page71" id="page71"></a>[pg&nbsp;71]</span>
intention of keeping or remembering her obligations
to your own dear self or to any one else, not even her
own abused and neglected sisters,&#148; wrote she, at
length, winding up with the admonition that would
he save himself harm he should act at once.</p>
<p class="indent">Having sooner made without any success several
attempts at communicating with Yodogima, this first
missive of an avowed friend&mdash;whom he believed to
be turned somewhat practical and not at all sentimental&mdash;quite
overcame Ieyasu, wholly upsetting
the meager plans that he had evolved for the at least
temporary subversion of a prospective antagonist and
the immediate recovery of his truly dearer than ever
sweetheart. Conscious of the pitfalls with which she
must be surrounded, yet he could not believe her
untrue: realizing the dangerous ground upon which
he must tread, still he would not for that refrain from
attempting a personal visit; Yodogima had advised
him: she, if recovered at all, must be released by some
subtler art than war&mdash;Hideyoshi held it in his power
to crush him, and was he any less a diplomat?</p>
<p class="indent">Hitherto Ieyasu had held peace to be well gained
at any price, but now that love possessed him, burned
and coaled deep into the heart-chords, he had given
up the future, sold his soul for the loan of a force with
which to fight reasonably a single combat. Recalling
the occasion, he would have thrust Hideyoshi through
at the cost of a bushido: remembering Katsutoya&#146;s
warning, the barest conception of a laggard wit
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page72" id="page72"></a>[pg&nbsp;72]</span>
startled him into the first really energizing confession
that he had ever made:</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;I am unworthy of her.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">Everywhere around, men with less opportunity were
rising as if metalled to accomplish anything. He, too,
must do something to prove himself worth the confidence
of a true love&mdash;why not trust Esyo? Designing
to poison him against Yodogima, she had paved
the way only to a more questionable undertaking&mdash;that
of betrayal. Ieyasu answered the message
kindly, inclosing therewith another to Yodogima (also
intercepted), informing her of his intentions and
asking that she make ready.</p>
<p class="indent">Upon the arrival of the letter, Yodogima said:</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;I am going to confide in you, Esyo; you are a
sister&mdash;next to me&mdash;and have never proven false:
I just must have the confidence of someone; it is killing
me, this terrible suspense. Will you listen, dear?&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">Esyo nestled close to Yodogima&#146;s side, and looking
submissively into her face, begged:</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Let us trust each other, Yodogima; otherwise how
can we bear the awful burden of this horrid place?&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Ieyasu is coming; he has arranged it, and I am
going away from here, to be his wife, never to part
again.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;How nice that will be&mdash;but the castle! Had you
forgotten that?&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Yes; it shall then be yours; and you, a more
gracious queen.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">The bare thought of gaining such preferment only
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page73" id="page73"></a>[pg&nbsp;73]</span>
at the will of a much sought after sister, and that,
too, for the sake of serving rather her convenience,
stung Esyo as no words could have done. She would
fight out, now, the course sooner determined upon;
hence Hideyoshi, on the very next day, found it agreeable
to dispatch, without any compunction upon his
part, an invitation to Ieyasu forthwith to come to
Azuchi, there to pay respects and claim his intended
bride.</p>
<p class="indent">Other advice went along, however, as Jokoin well
knew, which was neither intercepted nor answered,
advising him to do no such thing, but to prepare himself
at once for defense.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page74" id="page74"></a>[pg&nbsp;74]</span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<p class="indent">In the meantime Ieyasu had concluded it wise to
listen to the proposals of Nobukatsu, his nearest
neighbor at the west and the eldest living son of Nobunaga:
pretender to the father&#146;s estates and brother
to Nobutaka, a recently defeated ally of Shibata.</p>
<p class="indent">This young man&#146;s prospects had been effectively
shattered, in consequence of the fall of the latter
and the removal of Ishida, his supporter, to Mino;
still he searched everywhere in the hope of finding
some daimyo minded and able to espouse his cause
against the now only too patently determined usurper,
Hideyoshi. Ieyasu based small reliance upon any
strength or power to be gained by as doubtful an
arrangement, but wanted more some plausible excuse
for the making of so unequal a stand; as had been
prematurely forced.</p>
<p class="indent">Nobukatsu was generally looked upon as the rightful
successor to his father&#146;s rank and place, hence any
friendship shown to him should in one way or another
develop some greater claim to popularity. It had
also come to be considered by neighboring daimyos as
little less than heroic even to dare attempt any sort of
armed defense against the up-to-that-time invincible
Hideyoshi. All these reasons were wholly patent to
Ieyasu&mdash;young, able, and perhaps ambitious. True
he had not given any especial thought to the future,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page75" id="page75"></a>[pg&nbsp;75]</span>
save only the immediate relations growing out of an
endowed situation, and&mdash;Yodogima. Love, with all
its soothingly absorbent benefactions, remained uppermost
in his mind: was the goad that directly spurred
him to undreamed energies and unlikely undertakings,
would risk his life and fortune for the pleasures
of a single, transcendent joy.</p>
<p class="indent">Yet underneath this younger development there
may have lurked the ecstacy of a sub-conscious determination
to loom large in the more sordid events then
subtlely approaching. Ieyasu bore the blood of the
Minamoto; those giants of old, whose daring alone
had curbed and clipped the Taira: with such a prestige,
and so potent a cross, the temporarily humbled prince
of Mikawa, Ieyasu, may have inwardly harbored,
without any apparent conviction or consciousness, the
possibilities of a posterity acknowledging none other
for father than Ieyasu and for mother Yodogima.</p>
<p class="indent">And along with forced opportunity came the determination.
Nobukatsu once in his power would also
serve a ready means of compromise, in case of necessity.
The two armies were therefore consolidated,
and Ieyasu commanding assumed adroitly the defensive.</p>
<p class="indent">Never for a moment underestimating Ieyasu&#146;s
strength of purpose and force of character, Hideyoshi
made no less careful preparations, nor lost any
time in hurling his combined strength against him.
Hidenaga, his half-brother, forthwith recalled from
Tamba, was placed at the head, outranking both
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page76" id="page76"></a>[pg&nbsp;76]</span>
Kuroda, the Shintoist, and Takiyama, the Christian,
respectively at the head of the two main divisions
of the army and between whom vital differences had
arisen; one of the reasons ostensibly for the introduction
of a new leader and centralized authority&mdash;not,
in fact, because Hideyoshi himself at all times and in
every instance assumed absolute control and personal
direction: also anticipating as punctiliously the possibilities
of defeat, he would have someone upon whose
shoulders to shift the blame and the odium, hence the
second reason, for calling in Hidenaga, at this particular
time.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Do not, under any circumstances, allow some temporary
success to induce you to follow up the enemy,&#148;
enjoined Hideyoshi, against his departing generals, as
they marched off to war Ieyasu into submission, or
death&mdash;perhaps, in truth, if possible, the latter.</p>
<p class="indent">For the first time in his life, Hideyoshi remained
behind. No doubt he, too, had, in his way, conceived
the idea of a direct line, based also upon the progeny
of none other than Yodogima&mdash;and himself. To do
this he should not only crush Ieyasu in the East, but
must insure Yodogima against the dangers of intrigue
at home.</p>
<p class="indent">He could trust Oyea; she had never failed him when
treated fairly, and he believed her by this time fully
cognizant of the motive and utterly disdainful of the
effect that any such laudable undertaking might
wreak upon their sole relations; amicably settled,
hence reasonably sure of lasting countenance.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page77" id="page77"></a>[pg&nbsp;77]</span>
It was Esyo more than any other who caused him
uneasiness. True he had read the correspondence
and listened to her declarations without so much as a
doubt about the consequences or a suggestion that
could in any manner enlighten her, but what effect
would these, to him seemingly childish hazards have
upon Yodogima, a sister; and how would she demean
herself in the face of overburdening contingencies,
looming in all directions?</p>
<p class="indent">Without doubting in the least Hidenaga&#146;s ability or
faithfulness, he would have personally gone to the
front, immediately and without reserve: yet not alone
Yodogima&#146;s safety held him back; he must know more
of the natural workings of her heart, assure himself
first that some hope of reciprocal regard might bless
his innermost desire, for Hideyoshi would not risk
the breaking of an unalterable law: would rather
attune expediency to the demands of necessity, so
threw himself headlong into the merciless throes of a
self-willed, if far fetched, coquetry.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;I am interested to know more of your good self,
and of your delights and aspirations, Yodogima,&#148;
avowed Hideyoshi, frankly, and almost pathetically,
as the two met, accidentally&mdash;it may have been intentionally&mdash;while
strolling in the gardens, outside the
castle buildings, and overlooking the broad, transparent
waters of lake Biwa, in the distance.</p>
<p class="indent">Yodogima&#146;s heart fairly stopped, then beat ragingly,
though her face and manner indicated no perceptible
change or concern. She only looked the farther over
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page78" id="page78"></a>[pg&nbsp;78]</span>
an unbroken surface, save now and then a ripple that
yellowed and ruffled in the mellowed sun&#146;s rays of a
cloudlessly departing mid-summer day.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;You, too, seem bewitched of a prospect that always
gladdens, never denies me. Let us go there, you
and I, where we may have the world to ourselves,
leaving the castle, with its bickerings and battles and
their equations, away and behind.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">Nearly crying out, the now fast discerning princess,
almost overcome with eagerness, held fast hold upon
the face-chords; yet no longer vainly shying, permitted
a somewhat closer approach than before&mdash;if
none the less dignified or becoming, at that.</p>
<p class="indent">For the first time, though slight the occasion, Hideyoshi&#146;s
heart bounded with relief. The exactions of
war or the involutions of deceit no longer commanded
first attention; the faintest relaxation of a hard-held
and safely-guarded privilege had transfixed his whole
energy, wrought a new being; though the destiny of a
nation and the trend of government, henceforth and
always, might evolve therefrom.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;You shall not condescend to answer by word, however
pleasing that might be; goddesses have only to
will it thus or that, and mere man must break his
neck to do it so. Shall we go?&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Toward Hiyeisan?&#148; queried Yodogima, innocently,
yet significantly.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;No; in the opposite direction; across the lake. I
know a temple there, close down at the water&#146;s edge,
better rid of a kind and more select about its visitations,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page79" id="page79"></a>[pg&nbsp;79]</span>
where we can drink deeply and no mortal shall
question. Hence, Yodogima?&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;On one condition&mdash;but will not to-morrow do; I
cannot make answer so soon?&#148; promised she, thoughtful
to gain as much time as possible; having measured
accurately the probabilities of Hidenaga&#146;s advance.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Granted, my lady: what is it?&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;The condition is that my sister Esyo accompany
us&mdash;Jokoin nor Oyea would be either serviceable or
agreeable, as I believe, considering the purpose that
you have in mind and the rebellion that pours from
my heart. In as much, I have to ask you and you to
grant only this: that you heed nor hold me any other
or for more.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;What? Have you not heard of the hostilities?&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Yes; my sister told me about it.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Esyo?&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Yes.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;And&mdash;you have confidence in her?&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">The answer already on her lips, did not escape him,
though Yodogima hesitated; she had read him in
time to save herself&mdash;surmised that he knew more
than she would express or deny&mdash;and cogitating a
happier conclusion endeavored to leave him standing
as near the brink of certainty as it had been his pleasure
to assume.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;You would have me disown a sister?&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;I would know you better.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Then judge me with less compassion and more of
wit; I take the responsibility&mdash;&#148;</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page80" id="page80"></a>[pg&nbsp;80]</span>
&#147;Not of war?&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;No; but of its cause and consequence.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;I admire you all the more for that, though you
leave me without a peg to stand on. Nor shall I
surrender one whit the ground I&#146;ve gained, no less an
opinion formed. Take the whole family along, if
you like: their gadding, a virtue stands you none the
less in hand; to-morrow Hideyoshi shall know&mdash;&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;How it is to be tricked.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Ha, ha&mdash;you think me easily done.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">They sat upon the beach, in the afternoon of the
following day, Hideyoshi listening with rising anticipation
and Yodogima straining every wit she had,
prolonging and intensifying the illusion. She did not
know that Esyo had deliberately, if falsely, precipitated
the conflict, nor was she aware of Hideyoshi&#146;s
perusal of her own correspondence with Ieyasu&mdash;all
of it, excepting only the last letter, in which she
had advised him to make peace at any price, save
honor. Yet she was conscious that a conflict raged,
was perhaps at that moment fighting to the death,
between two unequal forces, in which no quarter
should be asked or given, and that her own lover was
desperately pitted in that struggle against the very
man who held her captive, grovelled at her feet a
weakling and a beggar.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Why should I not surrender, if needs be, this frail
body of mine to save him?&#148; again and again rose in
her mind, as often to be discarded and smothered as a
thing utterly impossible.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page81" id="page81"></a>[pg&nbsp;81]</span>
&#147;No; I&#146;ll yet win for him by subtler means an
equal chance; and when I&#146;ve done that&mdash;a woman
cannot do less: should do no more.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">A heron stalked by, disdaining a small crab that
backed and snapped among the slime-washed rocks:
Hideyoshi strained his eyes, meditating momentarily
the legend of a bygone day.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;A Heike?&#148; queried he, half aloud, rising to examine
more closely the supposed Taira symbol.</p>
<p class="indent">Yodogima&#146;s throat filled, and failed of utterance.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;It&#146;s only a common sort,&#148; observed he, returning
with the obstreperous little thing clinging tightly to
the stick&#146;s end.</p>
<p class="indent">Reseating himself, the conversation for once began
somewhat to lag. It was too soon yet to boat round
shady points or tempt strange communications from
the deep, so the two remained in the shade. Esyo
studied with unconcern the deeper mysteries of early
dragon-fly catching and the strange cupidity with
which the stupid long-bodied creatures permitted
themselves to be ensnared and haled to bay. Only
Oyea clung to the old temple, near by, farther up the
long, sloping incline; two lions carved in stone stood
sentinel there, and these she contemplated in prayer
to the good god who as earnestly watched over them.
Yodogima leaned forward, and for the first time induced
Hideyoshi to return her look without avoidance,
asking him:</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Do you believe in these tales of old?&#148; conscious
more of the temple than of crabs.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page82" id="page82"></a>[pg&nbsp;82]</span>
&#147;Perhaps&mdash;only, I might say, as occasion serves or
convenience requires.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Did anybody ever deem them differently?&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">Hideyoshi had neither the opportunity nor any
inclination to answer; a courier dashed up, breathless
and expectant, presenting him with a message from
the front.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Ha, ha&mdash;the fight is on,&#148; chuckled he, clapping
his hands and dancing about hilariously.</p>
<p class="indent">The intelligence roused added interest, as it only
could, but Yodogima continued in the full command
of her presence. She would have gladly surrendered
her life for a moment&#146;s encouragement to the man she
loved, yet as circumstanced would not lose her hold
upon him whom she loathed.</p>
<p class="indent">Hideyoshi approached closer: silence alone repulsed
him, the wisdom she displayed made ready the pyre,
and the dignity of her conduct set the torch that
lighted within a conflagration that conserved no
bounds. Only such as she could appease the appetite
of a true god. He must have her, let the heavens
fall.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Tell them,&#148; commanded he, &#147;that Hideyoshi fights
more fiercely, confronts a larger host, holds a vitaler
purpose, augurs&mdash;is just now engaged at the battle
of self. Go hence.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">The sun had set, and their little party, four in all,
sat round a repast; spread and served with hands
unsoiled, neither knowing an art nor upholding a truth
other than as willed them.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page83" id="page83"></a>[pg&nbsp;83]</span>
Oyea looked her sole lord in the face; she saw no
trace of chagrin or sorrow there; all her life had been
devoted to the smoothing of his pillow, the making of
a god, and to the serving of some purpose&mdash;just
what, she had never stopped to consider. Yodogima
sat near at hand, supremely reserved, withal grandly
inviting. Hideyoshi, the husband, too, was there;
and should Oyea be forgiven, perhaps, in that she
conceived him a little more godly for the taste and
the judgment of that selection? No other God condescended
to answer. She believed him more than
incarnate&mdash;</p>
<p class="indent">Another courier arrived, more anxious than the
first.</p>
<p class="indent">Hideyoshi grinned, this time; saying, calmly, without
any exultation:</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;The enemy wavers, and is&mdash;&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">Neither had this sentence been finished, when&mdash;Yodogima
said not a word nor did she show any
change of color, yet the blood seemed freezing in her
veins&mdash;Hideyoshi threw down the message, exclaiming:</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Tell them they know not what they say; an enemy
is never &#145;defeated&#146; till captured, decapitated, and discredited.
Go.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">Evening wore away, and none remained to render
the night&#146;s artfuller subtleties but Yodogomi and her
now slaving proteg&#233;; servants and others less welcome,
or more discerning, had found it convenient or expedient
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page84" id="page84"></a>[pg&nbsp;84]</span>
to busy themselves in more directions than one.</p>
<p class="indent">Esyo, paling at the significance of that last message,
no longer bandied discretion or consulted verity in
the making up of her mind just what she should or
would do. Ieyasu had been deceived and a sister
betrayed&mdash;what mattered; she would set things right,
at the cost of double-dealing&mdash;another?</p>
<p class="indent">Still a third courier bounded into the open room in
which they sat or lounged at will.</p>
<p class="indent">Hideyoshi grew apprehensive as he read; and gripping
the message, snarled:</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Ieyasu retreats&mdash;&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">Without concluding also this sentence or changing
his attitude, the puzzled daimyo, still blindly unconscious
of his own predicament, but bitterly alive to
the probability of Hidenaga&#146;s speedy annihilation,
turned to Yodogima, shamefully betraying, as he had
never done before, the inner hopelessness of a hotly
contested, fiercely grinding will determination. Her
head reeled&mdash;it seemed as if all were lost&mdash;but the
body responded, revealing no trace of the terrible
battle she fought: on higher grounds than he had conceived
or Ieyasu felt&mdash;in consequence of dreaming,
no less endangered by waiting. Forced and beaten,
Hideyoshi could bear the suspense no longer.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Is it possible&mdash;are you&mdash;in fact&mdash;a stoic? You
appear to be unmoved&mdash;unresolved&mdash;yet&mdash;Ieyasu
by retreating has won&mdash;has proven himself&mdash;to be&mdash;a
greater man than&mdash;no, no; I understand; know
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page85" id="page85"></a>[pg&nbsp;85]</span>
how it is to be tricked&#146;! Yodogima, I have no fine
speech to make or promises to render; to you, Ieyasu
owes it that he lives: an humbler admirer, only that
he can better respect.&mdash;Stay, you, courier; Hideyoshi
goes.&#148;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>

<p class="indent">Neither Hideyoshi, nor Yodogima, for the moment,
took any pains to discover or to suspect
the identity of that last message-bearer; though had
either one observed at all only the dishevelled clothing
he might have been induced to look underneath the
mask, hiding too slenderly a timid, anxious face. It
were enough for Yodogima to know that her lover
had risen to first place in the estimation of an only
rival: for Hideyoshi to realize once and for all that
the price of Shibata&#146;s eldest daughter was to be something
dearer than the lone bagatelle of a daimyo&#146;s
willing or the baser invocations of a traditional heritage.</p>
<p class="indent">Hideyoshi tore his way over the open road like mad.
The vitalest opportunity of his life had been denied
him, a victory snatched away that seemed almost
within grasp, and he himself written down an ass at a
time when his name should have been heralded
throughout the empire as invincible&mdash;and by the
doing of a woman.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Shame be upon they who think themselves sexed
into heaven; it is might that makes us what we are&mdash;right
or wrong, male or female, man or his kind.
Then beware!&#148; threatened he, as the dust rolled in the
wake of his ride toward the field.</p>
<p class="indent">Nor was Yodogima less conscious of a dawning
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page87" id="page87"></a>[pg&nbsp;87]</span>
respect for Hideyoshi. The knowing princess had expected
harsher treatment, if not more subtle means,
at the hands of her captor; who had, after all, proven
himself a respecter of ability if not an admirer of virtue;
and what if he should vanquish Ieyasu and, in
fact, carry out his ideas about total extermination?
The very thought of such a possibility deadened every
reason.</p>
<p class="indent">Esyo, too, had gone; she had devised less and reasoned
more, conjured her sister ambitious and charged
Hideyoshi with ungratefulness; she had witnessed,
become conscious of the latter&#146;s growing regard for
Yodogima in the face of all that she had done to
check it&mdash;to further her own designs&mdash;and now
turned to a newly devised, though less hopeful, expediency:
overcoming with difficulty the distance, soon
found herself in the bosom of Ieyasu&#146;s command; a
crooked purpose put to straights, knowing no rest
and once off, she did not lag so much, in fact reached
her destination before Hideyoshi had sighted his.</p>
<p class="indent">Thus abandoned by the only sister apparently left
to her&mdash;without some hint or even a surmise as to
the cause or purpose&mdash;and with a determined suitor
speeding toward the destruction of the only one she
loved, and with her own hands tied, and she powerless
to succor him, Yodogima turned to composure alone
for consolation&mdash;presumably a little body, unexpected
and unmindful, careless and happy, as if an angel from
heaven, tripped lightly into her presence, and throwing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page88" id="page88"></a>[pg&nbsp;88]</span>
down a big, ungainly mask, bantered, rather provokingly,
if happily:</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;You didn&#146;t know me at all, did you?&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Jokoin!&#148; gasped Yodogima.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Yes; and Hideyoshi, with all his eyes, never saw a
thing. What stupid people.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;How did you find the way, Jokoin; and&mdash;what
brings you?&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;I came to tell you&mdash;I just couldn&#146;t wait; they
are such a poky lot, those captains and generals and
would-be gallants&mdash;and it isn&#146;t any trouble, at all, to
go anywhere one wants to go&mdash;how did you like my
disguise?&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;I hadn&#146;t thought about that&mdash;it looks a bit scant&mdash;but
where have you been?&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Oh, I&#146;ve had lots of fun; went to the front&mdash;but
Takiyama is a bore; can&#146;t think of anybody or talk
about anything save someone, said to have lived sometime,
called Christ&mdash;oh, but they&#146;re a pesky lot, these
Christians!&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Jokoin! How you talk!&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;It&#146;s their way and&mdash;quite catching, you know;
they say, there are a lot of them, already&mdash;in Hideyoshi&#146;s
service, though.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Please do not, Jokoin; I cannot bear it&mdash;to hear
you use such language.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Well, I gave them the slip, all right, and here I
am&mdash;but where are the men? Is Hideyoshi the only
one you had?&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Sister, you shock me; I cannot understand you!&#148;</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page89" id="page89"></a>[pg&nbsp;89]</span>
&#147;Oh, yes, you can. Just take a tumble. Turn a
somersault&mdash;you have no idea how easy it is; and
how stimulating, withal. I wouldn&#146;t be in love with
only one man, at a time, as you are, right now, this
very minute, for anything. It doesn&#146;t pay, at all, to
be sentimental.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">Yodogima did not answer, at once; she could not at
first, for want of composure; afterwards, perhaps,
because her own ideals seemed the harder to encourage
in the face of such light-heartedness; but finally, that
joy which is wrought only in the crucible of a convicted
enlightenment opened wider still the floodgates
of confidence, bidding her say:</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Jokoin, let me tell you that to love is a sacred
thing; and if you care to win and hold a man&#146;s regard,
then learn to use your tongue, but keep in hand the
heart.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;As you did with Ieyasu. Poor fellow. They say
he is about to croak from distraction.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;I do not know what you mean; your speech has
become quite unintelligible. Someone must have exercised
a strange influence upon you.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;It&#146;s the newfangled religion&mdash;I&#146;ve got it, I&#146;ll admit&mdash;though
it&#146;s the worst sort of a makeshift and
good only for those who need it, who practice it, and
who believe in it. Why, Yodo, under it, you can do
anything, then take a bath, bend the knee, and shout
for Christ&#146;s sake: he&#146;ll do the rest.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Horrors, sister; I do believe you are possessed!&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;So are you, Yodogima, and all the rest&mdash;everybody,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page90" id="page90"></a>[pg&nbsp;90]</span>
dead or alive, born and unborn; only you don&#146;t
know it, and for that must suffer: they say, go to&mdash;well
I can&#146;t just recall the name, and it&#146;s such a bad
place I won&#146;t startle you with mentioning it.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Please do not; I shouldn&#146;t comprehend it&mdash;but
what of Ieyasu? Why distracted?&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Because of your advice, and Esyo&#146;s treachery; she
fibbed on both of you to the one, and tried to inspire
the other wrongly: between the two of you he has
taken a tumble&mdash;as I but a moment ago said you
might find it advisable or convenient to do. The
whole enemy is afraid of him, their reports are all a
pack of lies, and nothing less than Hideyoshi&#146;s presence
can save Ieyasu&#146;s doing about as he pleases, in
these parts. Take courage, sister, and bet your boots
on&mdash;the winner; I am going to return, for the fun,
and if you wish shall give your love to&mdash;which one,
Yodogima?&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">Jokoin ran away, without giving her sister a chance
to answer had she possessed the courage or the patience
to do so; Yodogima loved too deeply, held life,
that she knew, as against death, its natural consequence,
too seriously revealed in the underlying humanities
of an established conduct, to bandy truth for
the sake of bolstering courage or lightening the burdens
of an ordered continuity.</p>
<p class="indent">Oyea proved a better counsellor, more a comforter,
and together they reconciled their returning, though
weary it was, toward the castle whence they had departed
so shortly, more hopeful, if less doubtful.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page91" id="page91"></a>[pg&nbsp;91]</span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<p class="indent">The homegoing over, both Yodogima and Oyea
settled down to a kind of preconceived expectancy.
Their place continued as before, under the
domination of a single master, the husband of the one
and admirer of the other, assuming the attitude more
of respecter than lover to either. Neither outranked
the other, as yet; nor did their proposed spheres, from
Hideyoshi&#146;s way of thinking, in any manner conflict;
nor were they at all inconsistent, as determined by
custom or tradition from time immemorial, with good
citizenship and right living: each cognizant of her
duty, and mindful of the respect due to the head of
the household as established and designed; no one
jealous or hateful or inconsiderate of another, but
thence possessed of the utmost confidence and respect
for each other; they both set their hearts and energies
to the accomplishment of one and the same end.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Do you love Ieyasu, Yodogima?&#148; queried Oyea,
one soft, suggestive evening, as they two sat in the
opened-up room, meditating, together, more than contemplating,
the possible outcome of that conflict&mdash;then
renewed and waging between the one&#146;s lover,
who had vowed to live only for her, and the other&#146;s
husband, whom she loved and hoped for quite as
much.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page92" id="page92"></a>[pg&nbsp;92]</span>
&#147;I do,&#148; answered Yodogima, with brightening eyes
and confident voice.</p>
<p class="indent">Oyea pondered now. She, too, felt the agony with
which Yodogima&mdash;whom she had come to love&mdash;must
receive the news: news that to her seemed otherwise
impossible of coming. And Oyea had taken
great pride in her husband&#146;s achievements; next to
her love for him, it had been her greatest concern.
Then she thought of her own position and Yodogima&#146;s
chance should Ieyasu fall; Hideyoshi spared not an
enemy, and halted nowhere in the resolving of his
plans: if not by force, then by subtler means&mdash;still
harder to bear. Suddenly her expression strangely
changed, and turning to Yodogima, she said, reassuringly:</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Then I trust he shall not lose.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">Yodogima&#146;s eyes softened; and bowing low, out
of respect, but struggling hard against scruple, the
more finely wrought princess thanked her benefactress,
saying:</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;How can I ever requite such generosity.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">Time wore away dull and anxiously at the castle,
till presently word came of the great battle of Komakiyami,
where Hideyoshi&#146;s advance had been checked,
all his ready attempts at bribing the enemy&#146;s superior
officers put to naught, and Ieyasu with inferior numbers
had, at last, given his opponent such a thrashing
as none thought possible: in view of further developments,
proving to be the initial of a series of engagements
that were to revolutionize government, change
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page93" id="page93"></a>[pg&nbsp;93]</span>
the trend of civilization, and leave, perhaps, its lasting
imprint upon the future higher destiny of all mankind.</p>
<p class="indent">Ieyasu drove the foe out of his territory and
across the river, then halted to reorganize his broken
lines and conserve better their resources; Esyo deliberately
told him that Yodogima had grown indifferent,
his own intelligence warned him of Hideyoshi&#146;s recuperation,
and whether convinced of the former or
frightened at the latter the not over confident victor
in place of following up a first triumph resolutely set
himself down again to defend, once more to wait.</p>
<p class="indent">Hideyoshi, on the other hand, had in the meantime
found it convenient or wise to consult Oyea; and
whether acting upon her advice to make friends with
Ieyasu or designing to accomplish by unfair means
what he had failed of doing with arms began forthwith
to reconstruct the shattered fragments of his
sorely beaten army, recruiting with additional levies
and intrenching himself as best he could to scare or
mislead the enemy into remaining within the confines
of his own domain. And there they stayed, bickering
and bartering, one on either side the river Komaki,
both afraid but eager, till diplomacy had been for the
first time developed into a sufficiently vital force to
make war a more extensive if not crueler means of
settling dispute and rolling onward the vast, silent
confusion of ethical entities.</p>
<p class="indent">To do this, and to carry forward each his advantage
in the exercising of so little known an agency,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page94" id="page94"></a>[pg&nbsp;94]</span>
neither one halted, but adjusted his conscience in the
use of instruments that the heroics had held sacredly
above the sordid selfishness of eager quest; woman
must be permitted to degrade herself&mdash;yes, should
be used&mdash;that man&#146;s supremacy be not endangered
or questioned in its strident march toward the goal
of a collectively devised, pampered, vain, and self-denying
individuality.</p>
<p class="indent">Esyo and Jokoin were both taken advantage of.
The latter to carry tainted messages from a scheming
father, by adoption only; she could cross the river
and thus avoid an encounter that other men than
Hideyoshi in those days had courted as manlier&mdash;Ieyasu
would not harm or hinder a sister to his love,
whether doubted or mistaken, or both. Esyo served
Ieyasu in a like capacity; not, however, until the
younger man had despaired of his challenge to the
other to meet him in personal combat.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Tell your master, or father, or whatever he is,&#148;
said he to Jokoin, in answer to Hideyoshi&#146;s repeated
attempts, &#147;that our contention is purely personal, and
that neither he nor I have any right to compromise
a matter of heart, or to sacrifice the lives of others
and the welfare of a community to settle that kind
of difference. Let us then invoke a juster means.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;But we cannot do that except it be the will of the
one for whom we fight; Hideyoshi shall not stop short
of death,&#148; replied he, without reserve.</p>
<p class="indent">It was agreed that they should abide the decision
of Yodogima; but how obtain an impartial declaration
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page95" id="page95"></a>[pg&nbsp;95]</span>
from her? Ieyasu insisted upon her presence:
Hideyoshi declared himself indifferent.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;If you want her to come here it will be necessary
for you to fetch her: if you wish to right the matter
there, why, then, go; until settled Hideyoshi shall
employ such means as lie within his power to invoke.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">In possession, Hideyoshi&#146;s position seemed tenable;
now, no one knew better than Ieyasu the tactics with
which his adversary would gain an advantage, though
prone to make no promise or engagement that he
should not keep. Nor did Ieyasu let himself be
deceived as to his own resources or ability. True he
had won a great victory over Hideyoshi, had taught
him to know that willing and doing are two very
different terms, and that gods ready-made or self-devised
are alike amenable to the unflinching laws of
inevitableness, but would not budge his ground, Hideyoshi&#146;s
resources or Yodogima&#146;s failure to the contrary
notwithstanding.</p>
<p class="indent">Yet he must do something, either push forward or
lose the vantage gained. What was it that stirred
within and would not let him dismiss an only alternating
thought:</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Compromise?&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;No, no; Ieyasu could not do that; but&mdash;confidence!
now I have it; I&#146;ll trust somebody&mdash;Esyo!
she shall hear Yodogima speak the word, will tell me
the truth; confidence and not compromise, therefore,
is the final arbiter of our destiny. Then why doubt,
why have I doubted Yodogima? No; it is my short-sightedness
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page96" id="page96"></a>[pg&nbsp;96]</span>
and not her faithlessness that has caused
me all these bitter misunderstandings; she will approve
me right, and I shall prove her mine.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">Slow with inception but quick to apprehend, Ieyasu&#146;s
energies once kindled burned with a vigor and
a glow as refreshing and as inspiring as waiting had
been portentous. He would have it settled once and
for all that his love had not been misplaced, and that
he himself were the rightful suitor: Hideyoshi, but a
mongrel pretender, an empty claimant.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Go to Yodogima, and get her answer, if this
monkey-faced deceiver would yet know that she is a
princess, worthy a prince&#146;s love,&#148; commanded he, of
Esyo&mdash;as she, and Jokoin, departed upon their mission,
as arranged, under a truce, of sufficient length&mdash;no
doubt whatsoever in his mind as to what that word
should be.</p>
<p class="indent">The two sisters proceeded toward Azuchi, together
and unhampered, united in their great expectations
but widely divergent upon lesser grounds, those of
apprehension. Esyo reasoned that Yodogima must
say &#147;No,&#148; and by so doing relieve her of the necessity
for devising an untruth; Hideyoshi had sent Jokoin
along for no other purpose than to make sure the
delivery of the answer he, too, believed Yodogima
should return. Jokoin anticipated alone the boredom
of that to her way of thinking needless journey, for
how could a princess, her own sister, so spoil a good
prospect by saying anything but &#147;Yes&#148;?</p>
<p class="indent">They had arrived now, and Yodogima received them
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page97" id="page97"></a>[pg&nbsp;97]</span>
in her boudoir&mdash;still open at the rear and overlooking
the narrow lowland, butting up against a somber
woods that covered a steep rising hillside beyond&mdash;yet
it was growing late. There was no one to disturb
them; Oyea had withdrawn to her own desolate chamber,
apprehensive but resigned. Yodogima sat facing
the dark of nightland. Jokoin at once became spokesman;
she could not wait. Esyo held no interest in
the gathering portent without, nor did she betray a
conscious thought of things more ominous within.
The clouds hung low and the air around dulled against
the dead monotony of dawning sleep, over-borne and
unrelated save as lettered against nature&#146;s unfathomed
deep by myriads of changing, ever-noiseless fire-flies.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Come reason with me, with you and with him,
verily the God-truth to know,&#148; pleaded Yodogima,
silently, of the great, fathomless unreality lying just
beyond, always ahead, alluringly beckoning, yet so
disparagingly mute.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Really, one might think you lost in dreamland,&#148;
ventured Jokoin, after waiting some seconds, patiently,
perhaps, because quite satisfied.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Not dreaming, but coaxing,&#148; replied Esyo, &#147;and
were I in Yodogima&#146;s place I should do more than
that; I should take the matter into my own hands, and
answer as reason might dictate.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Sister!&#148; cried Yodogima. &#147;Would you, truly,
deny your God, to satisfy vanity&mdash;and know him?&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;I should do the most sensible thing under the circumstances:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page98" id="page98"></a>[pg&nbsp;98]</span>
you have my deepest sympathy, Yodogima,&#148;
continued Esyo.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;And, what is more, I have confidence in you,&#148;
replied Yodogima.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Well, I suppose, I&#146;m not in it, then,&#148; suggested
Jokoin.</p>
<p class="indent">Neither sister answered; Esyo found it enough to
resist expressing some sort of feeling, and Yodogima
no longer interested only in the voiceless heavens,
pondered the possibilities of Ieyasu&#146;s proposed encounter.
Nor could she quite bring herself to trust
probability, for had not Hideyoshi once vanquished
the great Mondo, outwitted Kemotsu? What if her
lover should meet with a worse fate, and that, too,
only for her?</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;No,&#148; said she, to herself; &#147;it must not be.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">Then the chance of his winning began to take hold,
and her pulses tingled, and the spirit verge spoke in
the voice of an ancestor:</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Yes,&#148; whispered she, inaudibly, though the fire
shone from her eyes as it had a Taira&#146;s ages ago.</p>
<p class="indent">Esyo paled at the thought: Jokoin bounded up, proposing:</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Shall I shout it aloud, sister?&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Jokoin!&#148; commanded Esyo; how can you so profane
things? Yodogima has not yet invoked understanding:
neither flesh nor spirit alone satisfies conscience.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">For the moment Yodogima seemingly forgot the
terrible test that raged and calmed alternately within.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page99" id="page99"></a>[pg&nbsp;99]</span>
Facing Esyo, and penetrating with only a glance the
thin gauze veiling a sister&#146;s underlying purpose, Yodogima
said, complacently, though firmly:</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;One would think this solely a matter of yours,
Esyo. Possibly you had best answer instead, that I
may learn also your pleasure; and, perchance, the
motive.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">Esyo flushed, and Yodogima read her as written.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Come closer, Jokoin; I want to feel the warmth
and cheer of your presence; it is an inspiration, if not
a reason: Esyo is so cold; oh, so unsatisfying, yet also
inspiring. Between the two of you I am thrust back
upon heart, and shall answer neither &#145;yes&#146; nor &#145;no.&#146;
Let them fight, if they will, but tell them, both alike,
that they are men: that Yodogima shall let neither one
answer to his God for a mistake of hers. It is a
woman&#146;s province to bear and not to succor man.
Good-bye, and when you have need for comfort and
less to know then come again; I love you both.&#148;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>

<p class="indent">The resolving in her own mind of a determination
so vital to herself, to her lover, and to
others with whom she had to do, had driven Yodogima
well nigh unto the brink of distraction. She
respected the rights of all, loved as only in truth she
could, and held self above the unlettered reach of personal
prowess alone; the community had dawned,
laid claim to its higher purpose, and held her like a
moth lured thither to the candle fire. She would not
preach the latter, could not practice the former, hence
fell back upon impulse as an only guide.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Let them fight,&#148; repeated she, when alone and
reflecting, &#147;the one ambitious and the other uncertain;
I would be neither, and justice will be done&mdash;but, is
not he my God? What other hope? Forgive me!&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">Presently Oyea came to her.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;You did right, Yodogima, and he shall understand,
if such be meet; and who can better judge than he?
What of the fathers, of tradition, of&mdash;&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Hush-sh-sh&mdash;it seems to me I hear a voice&mdash;no,
no; it is only he; my God, my Due: I am mindful of&mdash;Obedience.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">Upon receipt of her declaration, Ieyasu forthwith
charged Yodogima with unfaithfulness; he believed
now that Hideyoshi had found it possible only through
her to checkmate his every move to reach and liberate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page101" id="page101"></a>[pg&nbsp;101]</span>
her, had moved upon him thus prematurely but to
satisfy a wavering ambition of hers. Esyo seemed not
of sufficient consequence to arouse in him any apprehension
from that source; her last protestations appeared
to be reasonable enough in view of Jokoin&#146;s
passive assent, and without looking behind the scenes
to discern any better reason further for assuming
individual risk, at once set himself about to exact the
best terms obtainable.</p>
<p class="indent">Love had been the one thing to swerve him, and to
disturb the plan that he had evolved earlier in life to
build up and round out an existence both useful and
to the purpose: he would have no more of it. Hideyoshi,
on the other hand, had indulged only as convenience
or policy dictated, hence came to look upon virtue
as a ruling passion: made it the goal and not his
guide.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;You are at liberty to name the terms,&#148; urged Hideyoshi,
upon Ieyasu, more in irony than of earnest;
no longer doubtful about the latter&#146;s attitude, toward
Yodogima.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;I want neither women nor wealth; they are alike
fatal to government,&#148; retorted Ieyasu, neither heedless
nor unready.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Oh, very well; we shall omit the latter, if you like,
but the former are indispensable, I take it; however,
one or so more or less doesn&#146;t matter much, to me;
besides, you may change your mind: Hideyoshi can
then the better supply you: my collection is not a mean
one&mdash;&#148;</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page102" id="page102"></a>[pg&nbsp;102]</span>
&#147;And your mother a good enough security. What
say you to that, bickerer?&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;It is agreeable: you can have her, as hostage, of
course.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Hardly for another purpose, as a matter of choice;
knowing her son, as I do.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;There are worse mothers&mdash;you will not deny her
the comfort of a daughter, my sister Saji?&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;I can relieve you as well of her support, if that is
any object.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Thanks. She may not seem extravagant to Ieyasu.
And, you might not dislike, also, Jokoin, my
recently adopted daughter?&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Perhaps I had better take, instead, Esyo, and make
an end of it.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;As you like; Hideyoshi is not over nice, or particular,
or exacting.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;And Ieyasu wants nothing not bargained for, and
takes no less.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;We shall see,&#148; replied Hideyoshi, satisfied with
the deal, and anxious to put it to the test without
further parley or encumbrance.</p>
<p class="indent">Hideyoshi forthwith produced as hostage his mother,
Naka, accompanied by her daughter, Saji, apparently
to keep her company, and by Esyo, whose presence,
already assured, served no better her purpose than
Hideyoshi&#146;s pleasurable riddance if not her sister Yodogima&#146;s
more respectful quest. In consideration of the
security tendered, Ieyasu agreed henceforth only to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page103" id="page103"></a>[pg&nbsp;103]</span>
recognize Hideyoshi as supreme at Kyoto, the capital:
Hideyoshi, as usual, made no promises.</p>
<p class="indent">Returning to Azuchi, word forthwith spread of
Hideyoshi&#146;s wonderful success; he had demonstrated
the potency of diplomacy as against the cruelties of
war&mdash;true no one knew quite the terms of their alliance,
except they themselves, and seemingly neither
one had gained an ostensible advantage, save, perhaps,
Ieyasu; who, as was patent, held the highest possible
hostage, yet for what none surmised; or, as events
proved, really cared. Nobody&#146;s domain had been
depleted or augmented, and Ieyasu&#146;s prestige gained
by the battle won remained unquestioned; he had
never disputed Hideyoshi&#146;s supremacy at Kyoto, hence
could not be charged with losing anything by recognizing
that. On the other hand, Hideyoshi carried
with him the odium of defeat in battle, against which
the successes of so little known an agency as diplomacy
would not have counted for much had he not again
looked ahead into the, to him, truly inexhaustible unknown,
there discerning still a newer and more effective
builder, publicity.</p>
<p class="indent">The money, therefore, that Ieyasu might have
exacted as tribute was at once put to a better use,
and the women, whose influence he preferred to despise,
were not at all slow with experiencing some
change of heart, if not of grasping at real opportunity.
Yodogima held steadfast to her purpose. Oyea might
have been pardoned for a growing conviction that her
lord ruled right in any circumstance and that, perhaps,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page104" id="page104"></a>[pg&nbsp;104]</span>
Yodogima were, after all, a bit ungrateful; but others
less disappointing and with more to gain eagerly outbid
themselves to do his reverence honor&mdash;Grace of
Tango, daughter of Akechi Mitsuhide and wife to
Hosokawa Tadaoki, cast her jewels into the fund that
was forming to bid Hideyoshi enter the capital as a
god no less than laurel crowned.</p>
<p class="indent">The monks of Negoro were crushed, the South subdued,
and the exalted office of Kwambaku (Regent)
was conferred upon him, by no less an authority than
the mikado himself&mdash;Yoshiaki, the deposed shogun,
refused to adopt the lowly-born Hideyoshi, as requested,
thus enabling him to be declared shogun;
Katsutoya still remained at large.</p>
<p class="indent">From a huge platform at Kyoto great treasure was
distributed, and the barons bended their knees: from
far and near they came, women clamored for admission
to his court, but there was one who looked deeper
than affectation; either upheld or condemned, as inwardly
judged; and Hideyoshi, if none other, revered
her for it, made her his goddess, and worshipped
thence at mercy&#146;s will.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Tell me, Yodogima, what is it I can do to sever the
heart-strings that bind you to another? I am not deceived.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Then you are not a god: I thought you invincible?&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">Ieyasu had settled down to the rebuilding of his
fortunes at home, apparently content that he had not
been shorn of his estate, had gained the prestige of a
victory won at arms&mdash;a thing hitherto wholly unrenowned
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page105" id="page105"></a>[pg&nbsp;105]</span>
for&mdash;and that Yodogima no longer appeared
to weigh in the scales of duty or ambition; Esyo had
doctored up his conscience on that score as best she
could, and results proved her no mean attendant; but
there was one thing that disturbed him: How could
Hideyoshi make so much capital out of so little gained?</p>
<p class="indent">After all, had he not underestimated the potency
of money as shown in the resolving of publicity, so
new, save only to Hideyoshi, yet apparently more vital
in the attainment of power to do than was character
essential or determinate when once invoked or accepted?</p>
<p class="indent">It may have been some dawning eagerness on his
part to recoup his loss in that direction, or to take
advantage in the future of Hideyoshi&#146;s now more than
ever patent initiative, or it may have been a growing
distrust of or resulting dislike for Esyo, and his vain
though unstudied attempt to rid himself of the one by
leaning toward another: whatever the cause, Ieyasu
became more and more reconciled to the presence, if
not the advances, of Saji: she did make advances,
though innocent enough and wholly legitimate on her
part. Hideyoshi knew. Nor was any opportunity
neglected to let those little surmisings reach and sear
the trend of another&#146;s confidence, yet Yodogima&#146;s love
for Ieyasu flamed on; faith, hope, and charity
rounded out the dull monotony of neglected opportunity,
making life to her after all worth the living,
the striving, and the getting.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;He is mine,&#148; whispered she, to herself, repeatedly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page106" id="page106"></a>[pg&nbsp;106]</span>
pillowing her head upon an untouched but conscious
rest.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;By heavens, I&#146;ll make him another&#146;s,&#148; vowed Hideyoshi,
as often, yet with no less respect.</p>
<p class="indent">All the home provinces and every conceivable approach
to the capital now rested securely within the
keep of Hideyoshi. The mikado subservient or cowed,
and a supervisory authority exercised by himself.
His will alone the government, and the nation fired.
The populace coerced, neighboring daimyos whipped,
and the South in his clutch, there remained only the
North as an excuse for putting Ieyasu further to
test and laying threadbare before her own eyes what
he believed to be Yodogima&#146;s last prospect there.</p>
<p class="indent">Hojo of Odawara had not yet paid his respects to
Hideyoshi, nor had Date, still farther to the northward,
tendered submission. They were powerful
barons, the former fighting his way from insignificance&mdash;really
from a merchant with a pack on his
back&mdash;to the lordship of five great provinces, the
Kwanto, with a fortified castle at Odawara, intrenched
behind mountain gorges at the west and the sea to
the southward: a position hitherto held as impregnable
as it was desirable. Date fared less well as to defenses,
lying largely in the open and depending more
upon his neighbor Hojo for protection against the
West, but he was none the less rich and perhaps more
judicious for that; hence, the greater desired by Hideyoshi.</p>
<p class="indent">Realizing that a blow at Hojo meant an equal and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page107" id="page107"></a>[pg&nbsp;107]</span>
a mutual response from Date, Ieyasu had good reason
under a strained or liberal construction of the terms
and conditions of their alliance to respond to Hideyoshi&#146;s
call for assistance. The two armies moved in
concert upon Odawara&mdash;Hideyoshi as aggressor and
Ieyasu his support.</p>
<p class="indent">It was in the springtime, when roads were open
and fain nature leaping forth in heart or bud. They
had fought their way over the summit and driven in
the nearest outpost: Hojo entrenched himself behind
the walls of that castle, seemingly safe without and
provisioned within.</p>
<p class="indent">Hideyoshi reckoned differently; besides, had other
ends to gain. Ieyasu awaited the advance patiently,
but a deeper hold hung dangerously over him, grappled
him and snarled him and swayed him, till in
the end reason had doubted his entity.</p>
<p class="indent">Hojo lay penned in. Date suspicioned his friend&#146;s
inability to withstand the siege. Ieyasu and others
under Hideyoshi&#146;s command bore the delay somewhat
indifferently. Hideyoshi, of a sudden, in the face of
war, inaugurated the most unheard-of festivities and
amid the revelries pursued his own secret purpose.</p>
<p class="indent">From the castle to the sea spread the city, with its
activities and its apprehensions. To the north and
west rose high hills, studded in their lower slopes
with the luxury and the content of higher living. Here,
at Ishigaki hill, well up on the side and overlooking
the castle, in the foreground, Hideyoshi pitched his
tent: the army encamped here and there throughout
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page108" id="page108"></a>[pg&nbsp;108]</span>
the city and his communications established there was
no need he knew or want devised that must not heed
his will.</p>
<p class="indent">Wide banquet floors were laid end to end round one
side the hill, roofed over with alternating sky and
bough: lined up in front of white paper screens, serving
as well to frighten the enemy below as to entertain
the guests assembling.</p>
<p class="indent">Large numbers of various classes, both of nobles
and the samurai, were invited&mdash;Date among the
rest; who, for some reason, known best to himself or
to Hideyoshi, secretly came, humbly awaiting the
host&#146;s still stricter pleasure. Geishas, musicians, players,
and favorites were called in thousands; a one
hundred days&#146; feast planned; Ieyasu made an honorary
host, and Yodogima brought from Azuchi to do
him service.</p>
<p class="indent">Other barons had been permitted to invite their wives
and their sweethearts&mdash;Ieyasu among them; Saji
served in a polite way, if not as a real love&mdash;but
Hideyoshi, in his higher capacity, either defying
custom or succoring freedom, wrote to Oyea granting
her only the privilege of delegating Yodogima in her
stead.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;As next to you,&#148; commanded he, &#147;Yodogima is my
favorite: send her along. You shall have me at your
side again when I return from the war.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">Yodogima came; it was her last chance, and she
Oyea&#146;s only hope.</p>
<p class="indent">Dancing and singing and feasting had waned, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page109" id="page109"></a>[pg&nbsp;109]</span>
stars shone bright overhead, and entering Hideyoshi
and Yodogima led the way, seating themselves, he at
the head with her at his right. Then came Ieyasu
and Saji; who arranged at the motion of Hideyoshi,
the former facing Yodogima and the latter himself.
Others swarmed in, in like fashion, till the half-moon
of gay and happy nobles reached round on either side
the hill, properly ranked, beyond the sight or hearing
of those honored with higher favors. Low, weird
strains issued from the half-hidden platform in front
where sat the players, grouped before rising ranks of
dancers&mdash;then posed and eager, now swaying and
relieved&mdash;banked against a background of green and
shadow. The gods breathed sparingly.</p>
<p class="indent">Ieyasu dared not raise his eyes from the floor.
Yodogima calmly awaited some initiative on his part;
etiquet bade her bide the pleasure of host or suitor
alike. Neither guilt nor remorse weighed at all upon
her conscience as it did heavily upon his. There,
before him, within reach of his every faculty, as innocent
and true, as sweet, as fair, and as appealing as
upon the day when he had pledged himself to die for
her&mdash;the bare thought of having tolerated another,
then sitting at his side, deadened intellect and sickened
the heart.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;How can I meet her look, return her confidence,
knowing as I do now that it is I and not she who is
false?&#148; asked he, of himself, till his heart seemed
breaking and his mind a mirage.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Perhaps it is too much, the demand greater than a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page110" id="page110"></a>[pg&nbsp;110]</span>
human can endure; I should not have come here,&#148;
reasoned she, equally as reserved, if more unconcernedly.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Beautiful beyond comparison,&#148; appeared to be the
verdict of every man or woman within sight of her,
and the suspense but quickened their judgment. Hideyoshi
gorged satisfied. He had provided every conceivable
device, no expense had been spared; for he
proved a lavish lover, and Oyea, from motive or pride,
had neglected neither art nor attention to relieve and
heighten either charm, or form; silks embroidered and
blended to a thread, laces representing the patience
and the labor of an exquisite design or appreciative
hand, pearls priceless in cost and emblematic of a
disposition which at least the donor had fathomed, all
these worn with grace, softened in modesty, and
inspired of eyes as keen as confiding, Ieyasu well
might suffer the torments of a troubled conscience&mdash;may
have asked himself earnestly and regretfully if
he had not wronged her.</p>
<p class="indent">In her mind no such thought had entered; she believed
herself in some way responsible for his apparent
neglect. Had she waned in his estimation? Were
Saji really more beautiful, still worthier of his admiration,
less exacting in her appeal? The blood rushed
to Yodogima&#146;s face, momentarily tingeing the hitherto
untroubled countenance that made her queen. Hideyoshi
as quickly came to her relief; he should not see
her overtried. Proud, and observant, he would stake
his life, make some sort of effort to hew the way that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page111" id="page111"></a>[pg&nbsp;111]</span>
she might reign, resolve her proper place and prove
the man whose worth alone might justify his claim.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;A toast, Yodogima&mdash;I am sure that Ieyasu shall
appreciate it&mdash;Saji might the better serve Hideyoshi&#146;s
dull wit,&#148; suggested he, by way of relief.</p>
<p class="indent">Yodogima raised the cup. She would not disobey,
nor would she neglect an opportunity. She believed
Ieyasu true, and held him ready as well. Hideyoshi
had granted her the privilege, and made it possible
for Ieyasu to place beyond all doubt the inviolability
of their love.</p>
<p class="indent">Would he do it? Such a question never entered her
mind. Could he? She deemed him incapable of failure.
Hideyoshi was as good as his word, had to her
proven himself beyond peradventure: perhaps it was
something of triumph which prompted the words, it
might have been a dawning bit of jealousy inspiring
the thought, more likely it were a prospect of truth&#146;s
obtaining that urged the will to claim its mastery, but
whatever the cause, the motive proved none the less
discernible. Yodogima faced her lover, not exultantly,
yet assuringly, saying:</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;While climbing the hill of prosperity, I hope never
to meet you.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">Ieyasu&#146;s eyes for the first time rose to hers, fairly
and unflinchingly. The old love once again possessed
him, for the moment flared every torch, forced recognition,
and the soul revealed its innermost secret&mdash;Hideyoshi
waited: possibly the mind waxed hot, but
not a hand trembled. Then the message itself began
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page112" id="page112"></a>[pg&nbsp;112]</span>
to claim attention, and directly the puzzling significance
of those words dulled and gathered against a
waning, startled consciousness till vanity bade Ieyasu
conjure no shameless thought:</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;What does she mean?&#148; queried he, of himself,
looking from one to another, the while his eyes falling
bewildered and helpless before the alternating gaze of
Hideyoshi.</p>
<p class="indent">Yodogima changed to scarlet, then whitened; she
had surrendered life itself to recall the words, perhaps
too thoughtlessly spoken.</p>
<p class="indent">Was it charity, or revenge, that prompted Hideyoshi?</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Coming down,&#148; suggested he, to Ieyasu, no doubt
triumphantly, but none the less mercifully&mdash;putting
into his mouth the words that he had floundered so
bitterly to command or riddle.</p>
<p class="indent">Shame overcame any better impulse, and turning
upon his adversary, Ieyasu half whined, half scowled:</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Perhaps you yourself had best drink the toast.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;To-morrow, I may; or, perchance, it shall not be
until the next day; thank you,&#148; replied Hideyoshi, not
the least perturbed.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page113" id="page113"></a>[pg&nbsp;113]</span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<p class="indent">All the powers of earth could not have tried the
princess more; she realized now that she had,
out of zeal, overtaxed Ieyasu, and in that opened the
way for Hideyoshi perhaps successfully to pit a wit
against her lover&#146;s returning steadfastness.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Oh, it isn&#146;t much, after all, and&mdash;I can propose
another,&#148; stammered she, though composedly, in some
vain way to stem the tide and save still the man she
adored; just why, she could not tell nor would others
surmise.</p>
<p class="indent">The suggestion fell cold upon Ieyasu&#146;s now
troubled conviction; he had been outdone by a rival:
there was not the slightest doubt about that in his
mind; Ieyasu respected aptness, even though himself
slow to act. Nor was he longer in doubt as to Yodogima&#146;s
constancy or love; one glance had convinced
him beyond recalling, and he could not have envied,
for he had often said that the secret of happiness lies
in kindly feeling. Then what was it that prompted
him quickly to answer:</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Not to-day, but to-morrow?&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;As the princess likes,&#148; retorted Hideyoshi, his
admiration growing with quest and confidence.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;More&mdash;it is a guest&#146;s pleasure,&#148; commanded she,
replacing the cup and glancing at Hideyoshi, without
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page114" id="page114"></a>[pg&nbsp;114]</span>
so much as disturbing a visitor or confusing their
host.</p>
<p class="indent">That evening was thence passed without further
incident, save an apparently growing discomfiture on
Ieyasu&#146;s part and the corresponding rise in spirit of
Hideyoshi; who not deigning to parley with Yodogima&mdash;he
took her at her word, and prided himself in doing
so&mdash;began resolutely further to carry out and not to
forestall. Yodogima had done her part, and well:
there seemed nothing more that she could or would do
to save a waiting lover; she had made it possible for
him to claim her, and to drink the draught that Hideyoshi
himself should not have questioned, and he had
failed to do either&mdash;might be as easily duped into a
more fatal blunder, made the scapegoat of his own
waiting or incapacity, or both, and the princess at once
raised above his further consideration.</p>
<p class="indent">Thus Hideyoshi planned and Ieyasu dallied, perhaps
dreamed, and marvelled the audacity, perchance
effect, with which Yodogima commanded, possibly
ordered. The following day, however, clouded over
and Date and Hideyoshi counselled and bantered till
early evening, when they stood on the latter&#146;s suggestively
improvised ramparts cogitating the plight of
Hojo farther down in the foreground.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;You are the greater man,&#148; plead Date, no longer
doubtful of Hideyoshi&#146;s resources or motive, &#147;and I
am ready to surrender my lands and do you service.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Ah; then you shall know what it is to toast a man
like Hideyoshi; to-night you shall sit next to me; and,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page115" id="page115"></a>[pg&nbsp;115]</span>
by the way, face the smartest woman in these parts:
look you well that your tongue neither outruns nor
belies the manner due or occasion expected.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">At table Date, true to conviction and in consonance
better with propriety, proposed the health of Hideyoshi,
their duly lord and henceforth recognized
master.</p>
<p class="indent">Flushing scarlet, Yodogima barely touched the cup
that stood filled for another purpose; it seemed to her
that Ieyasu, who now sat at her side, must intercede,
should realize that opportunity were fast slipping
away: he only whitened, then drank the liquor as
prudence dictated.</p>
<p class="indent">Hideyoshi smiled, and turning to Date attempted
their present relief by suggesting, bluntly:</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;The princess reserves discreetly her response till
occasion more pleasantly affords; Ieyasu may yet
drink with a better color, if not more grace.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">The next day, in consequence, brought with it a
train of circumstances as swift as it had been unexpected&mdash;to
all except, perhaps, Hideyoshi. Matsuda,
Hojo&#146;s main reliance, had succumbed, not to valor but
to gold, and that night his master&#146;s head graced a place
at table&mdash;opposite to Ieyasu: who now, once more,
faced at greater distance Yodogima, but entertained
as before, close at hand, Saji, in whom the now startled
and cringing daimyo from Mikawa may have found
some little consolation, if not a rising prospect.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Let us now listen to Saji; it may prove to be not
only her fair due, but our most agreeable opportunity,&#148;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page116" id="page116"></a>[pg&nbsp;116]</span>
commanded Hideyoshi, in great liberality, as it appeared
to others, yet with a hidden earnestness that
neither Yodogima nor Ieyasu mistook.</p>
<p class="indent">Saji did as bid; it seemed quite immaterial to her:
all the heart that God had really given her had long
ago been drilled or tooled away, for Hideyoshi believed
in duty&mdash;ruled or reasoned to preach and practice
down or up as convenience less necessity required.
Ieyasu turned red.</p>
<p class="indent">A growing, pitiless consciousness began to take
hold on Yodogima&#146;s hitherto buoyant, confiding trust.
The very mat on which the princess sat seemed sinking
or rising as the moments flew or lingered. Alternating
flashes left her undetermined. Heaven or
worse had been a relief: Hideyoshi angered for once,
and for the first time looked his rival straight in the
face. Ieyasu&#146;s eyes fell to the significant fright
across the table. Yodogima&#146;s look then had strengthened
him, but he dare not meet her gaze.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Saji, Saji,&#148; mumbled he, half conscious, half appealingly.</p>
<p class="indent">She only smiled, but the dead lips of Hojo moved
him:</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;My wife, gentlemen, my wife!&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">Yodogima had been spared the sight of Hideyoshi&#146;s
gruesome lesson: likewise she had been denied its consolation;
yet she could believe Ieyasu&#146;s vain resolution
no less than final, if not voluntary. And it may have
been so. Like examples had been flaunted in the face
of others less capable or worthy, had been used time
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page117" id="page117"></a>[pg&nbsp;117]</span>
and again by men more considerate, if as determined,
but never before might the charge of cruelty be laid
at the door of Hideyoshi; who had suffered Shibata
the right of honorable demise, spared Shimadzu the
loss of his ancestral name, and let Ieyasu more than
once slip any fate that he might have chosen, still
Hojo&#146;s head must adorn a sorrowful plight.</p>
<p class="indent">And why?</p>
<p class="indent">The princess did not stop to inquire; she knew only
that she had suffered perhaps at their expense or for
their betterment, and the very heavens above seemed
bereft&mdash;earth had done its worst, the humanities
failed, all their Gods and Buddhas and Christs promised
relief only in death&mdash;save a certain star, that
seemed the brighter in its loneliness: ideality proffered
life.</p>
<p class="indent">Thereafter Hideyoshi summoned Ieyasu to the top
of a certain hill overlooking the fortress, the city, and
the country around.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;You perceive,&#148; suggested the former, &#147;that the
Kwanto is mine.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Y-e-s,&#148; stuttered Ieyasu, his mind far distant.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;You know that I am master, hereabouts, I take it?&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Yes.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Then I shall give you these provinces, in consideration
of&mdash;your services.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;What luck!&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Where will you live?&#148; inquired Hideyoshi, still
more suggestively.</p>
<p class="indent">Ieyasu again hesitated. He had set Yodogima
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page118" id="page118"></a>[pg&nbsp;118]</span>
aside and accepted Saji out of respect for a well-grounded
belief, had invoked self-denial to the point
of distraction, and bought peace at the cost of manhood,
but to surrender a birthright and abandon every
defense seemed more than he could do, even in the
face of rigid necessity. This man then would rule and
not ruin. Had Yodogima judged him more accurately
than he had done? Would she succeed? Pride urged
him now, forced the aggressive, hence prompted him
to answer:</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;At Odawara.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;No. I know a place, farther away, called Yedo
(Tokio). There is where you shall live.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Very well, my lord,&#148; replied Ieyasu, determined
now, whereas before he had provokingly waited.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<p class="indent">In the meantime there had developed within the
ranks, and outside as well, no inconsiderable
speculation as to what further to expect. Hitherto
Hideyoshi had found ample employment for all his
talents; from the beginning it had been one constant,
absorbing grind, but now that all the barons worth
the while had been subdued, the last man who could in
any manner check or hinder him apparently disposed
with, he more restless than ever, Hojo made an example
of, and Yodogima undoubtedly his keep, they
might well conjecture.</p>
<p class="indent">Already some ugly rumors had started, and circulated
(Esyo came and went at leisure), causing Yodogima
to ponder, no less made the master furious.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Eigh? A subordinate question his superior? Crucify
the culprit,&#148; commanded he, intending quite another
example.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;No,&#148; interposed Yodogima, complacently.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Well,&#148; replied Hideyoshi, to the officer, after a
moment&#146;s reflection, &#147;as the villain did not utter the
speech in my presence you may instead cut off his
head.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;No,&#148; repeated Yodogima, more positively.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Ah,&#148; ventured Hideyoshi, vainly cogitating some
sort of excuse, &#147;seeing he is a samurai, you had better
tell him to commit harakiri.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page120" id="page120"></a>[pg&nbsp;120]</span>
&#147;No,&#148; commanded Yodogima, now wholly conscious.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Promote him, then, for having done me a service,&#148;
directed he, still set upon some voice in the matter.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Not you, but me,&#148; retorted Yodogima, now fully
determined upon her part.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Why you; I am master, am I not?&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Not of me; and, I am going to see that you prove
yourself something more than a head-chopper.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;You have heard?&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Yes; Esyo just now told me all about it.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Women will talk,&#148; sighed Hideyoshi, mindful of a
hundred battle fields, and no one woman that he had
ever conquered.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;And I&#146;ll show you that they can do more,&#148; threatened
she, without a change to suggest an advantage.</p>
<p class="indent">Yodogima had taken desperate chances in calling
Hideyoshi to account as done, but she had studied him
well and believed herself capable&mdash;not that she
might have need to combat any mean advantage; but
gossip, vain assumption, had compelled now the assertion
and maintenance of a womanhood; which otherwise
had not been questioned.</p>
<p class="indent">Hitherto Hideyoshi had been held as interested only
in the affairs of men, wholly absorbed with the making
and unmaking of fortune or fortunes so distant
and neglectful of any influence that women might bring
to bear that none had essayed to do more than serve
and chatter for centuries; but now, that he had so
overstepped the bounds of conventional warfare as to
indulge effeminate pastimes and cringe in the presence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page121" id="page121"></a>[pg&nbsp;121]</span>
of a princess, he himself might be excused and she
most surely condemned.</p>
<p class="indent">Ieyasu, even, who knew in his own heart, looked
upon Yodogima&#146;s heroic stand as more the result of
sustained loyalty than innate purity.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;And that loyalty will preserve her, as self-denial
is to be the making of me,&#148; muttered he, to himself,
as the preparations for his submissive removal progressed:
that, from a rich and populous estate, where
men had learned to love and respect him from childhood,
would sacrifice their lives and their energies to
defend him, to a new, and a strange, and an isolated
keep, where disorder, dissatisfaction, and crude and
crumbling walls abounded: that, too, with only a bodyguard,
his Saji, and the vain, if not unscrupulous,
Esyo to accompany him.</p>
<p class="indent">And as the little straggling band marched away,
harboring its jealousies, it may be revenge, certainly
its ambitions, Yodogima turned from them in compassion&mdash;her
heart seemed breaking, but duty rallied to
the call of pride, and she forgave him, perchance
tried to forget.</p>
<p class="indent">Esyo could not be so easily dismissed; her parting
words had lingered, now roused in Yodogima to the
full some comprehension of what her father meant in
turning her out threateningly in the company of two
seemingly lovable and harmless sisters. His guidance
and protection had been a world to her now, that she
had, as she alone believed, reaped the fullest measure
of bitterness, wherein God has endowed that man shall
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page122" id="page122"></a>[pg&nbsp;122]</span>
covet. Charms had been easily flung at them, Esyo&#146;s
hinted admonition seized upon with avidity, and the
body sacrificed upon the altar of rapacity, but the
spirit rebelled and held her fast in its higher reach.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Perhaps, Yodogima, the bushido might afford you,
as it did our father, some really honorable means.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">Those words welled up and rimmed over in Yodogima&#146;s
heart, as molten lava heaves and lips and inflows
at the crater&#146;s edge. Esyo, a sister, had denounced
her, but something within, a promise somewhere,
sustained her, roused her to a deeper, broader
sense of duty than she could conjure forth of self-effacement.
Then Jokoin came, and only her presence
had made it seem once more as if earth truly held
some fair portion, but her counsel, too, seemed empty,
even blasphemous.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Christ is our redeemer; He died to save us; I am
confessed; hallelujah!&#148; shouted Jokoin, happy and
careless, if unmindful.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Sister! You shock me. Have you forgotten our
father?&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Oh, he&#146;s alright; he didn&#146;t know; the new religion
takes &#145;em all. Repent and be saved; quarrel and
separate; divorce and&mdash;do you know, they allow man,
big men, only one wife at a time; firstary, secondary,
or multipary? That&#146;s something!&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;I do believe you are losing your mind, Jokoin.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;That&#146;s nothing; go to Bungo; they&#146;re half daffy
there; and, they say, Hideyoshi, himself, would have
accepted Christianity were it not for giving up the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page123" id="page123"></a>[pg&nbsp;123]</span>
idea of more wives than one. I guess, though, he&#146;s a
stickler on that&mdash;perhaps, come to think, you may
know better than I?&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;I know my own mind; and that is more than it
would seem&mdash;there, Jokoin; it is enough; let us be
sisters&mdash;I presume there is nothing against that, in
your religion?&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Really, I haven&#146;t inquired: the priests will know&mdash;however,
we might just sort of hang out that way;
it&#146;s an elastic affair, this Christian religion, whatever
else.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">Withal her newfangled notions and queer mannerisms,
Yodogima found this little sister most stimulating
and satisfying to know and to cling to, however
trying or unreasonable. Each, it is true, had an ideal
of her own, quite as distinct and appealing to its possessor,
as Esyo&#146;s had been to her, yet neither one had
stooped to attain, nor would she. Jokoin had become
a Christian because it pleased her to do so: its revelation
had resolved more the humorous than serious,
the human and not the divine. A half century of
struggle and martyrdom had proven, if anything, in
their minds, that the Christian church, like all others,
were but a means to an end: that God alone is supreme&mdash;substitution
or addition or usurpation a dangerous,
designed, fleeting makeshift.</p>
<p class="indent">All these creeds had been threshed out in competition
and with vengeance&mdash;none had spared life or
property&mdash;and yet it seemed to Yodogima that she
must be saved: saved in accordance with precepts
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page124" id="page124"></a>[pg&nbsp;124]</span>
established and of a danger that to her were more
than death or salvation, or both, however atoned or
attuned. She must live, she must do, and in that
attain: in her prayer she asked for power and not for
ransom.</p>
<p class="indent">The whole camp now enlivened with bustle and
drive; each of the captains had been assigned his portion
or placed most advantageously, in their distributions
and allotments, and great preparations were
making for the leave-taking&mdash;some heart-rending,
others in good cheer. Most of Hideyoshi&#146;s leaders
shared Ieyasu&#146;s former possessions, but Gamo Ujisato,
one of Jokoin&#146;s recently ardent admirers&mdash;Takiyama
had been sooner banished to Kaga&mdash;without
leave or let, on her part, was set down at Aizu, in
the cold far north.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Never mind, Jokoin,&#148; promised Hideyoshi, upon
her remonstrance; &#147;you shall have left Ishida, and,
perchance, another, or some others, I fear too much
a mask for hypocrisy: with them, you should be able
to make out, if not capture the empire.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;What a bunch!&#148; replied Jokoin, sorely abashed.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Well, then, suppose you include your humble&mdash;ahem!&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;An old dried-up man like you? I had rather
try&mdash;&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Kyogoku?&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Yes; smart Alex; he has left a bit of ginger, if
not as much audacity as&mdash;some others.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Oho, aha; I can, perhaps, also, place him.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page125" id="page125"></a>[pg&nbsp;125]</span>
&#147;Not on your life.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;I wonder.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;I don&#146;t; I&#146;ve a sister.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;So, so; and two of them. It&#146;s a pretty nest or
nests, or something they build&mdash;I&#146;m building. Hideyoshi!
Whipped every man in Japan, that&#146;s worth the
trouble, and three will-o&#146;-the-wisps would set up housekeeping
on results. Esyo denies me, Jokoin defies me,
and Yodogima&mdash;you can go, young lady; you and
I couldn&#146;t quarrel, should we try; but, remember, a
bird in the hand is worth two in the bush&mdash;I wonder,
is Yodogima in a better mood?&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Don&#146;t do so much wondering. Just try your luck.
You ought to know how.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;I do; I do; I&#146;ll vow, you&#146;ve made a new man of
me.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;And you&#146;ve made me happy. What&#146;s the use&mdash;the
priests: the exiles&mdash;&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;There, now; run along; love and law&mdash;edicts must
be obeyed. Hang the villains; the bonzes were a blessing;
treachery is damnation!&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">Jokoin left him, standing in a rage; she knew very
well that he was then on the way to plead his own
cause in very different terms, if not with less success
than she had met in a manner so unexpected and unthought.
Two things, however, were accomplished in
that short, saucy, and withal agreeable conversation;
the kwambaku had been fairly warned as to Yodogima&#146;s
real temper, and he himself wrought into the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page126" id="page126"></a>[pg&nbsp;126]</span>
proper humor for his contemplated meeting: the fun
of taunting, had recompensed Jokoin.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;I&#146;ll have this thing settled, once and for all,&#148; muttered
Hideyoshi, as Jokoin disappeared behind a
moving cavalcade and he had turned to climb the hill
where Yodogima marvelled and fretted the tardiness
of his appearance.</p>
<p class="indent">An old yashiki (mansion) afforded the princess
temporary quarters farther up on the hillside and away
from the hurry-skurry of the camp below. It was
warm and restful, with a breeze blowing gently inland
from the ruffled bay in front and the seething ocean
beyond. Yodogima sat at the veranda&#146;s edge, high
upon the stone-abutting wall that terraced here and
there the hill&#146;s sharp incline or served as foundation
to some house perched high in air. The skies were
clear, and now and then a raven hawked his weird cry
aloft the stilled hamlets in front or clusters of seagull
reeled and fed in the distance.</p>
<p class="indent">No clouds of smoke darkened the outlook or blackened
these mats. Clanging bells and grinding wheels
there were none to awaken anxiety and shatter nerves.
The very exigencies of life found expression through
its subtler entities and not a sordid instinct lagged or
threatened fain regeneration. Man loved as always,
but gold for the sake of gold, greed that he might
gorge, or the dull clashing of horns had long ago
found their rest alongside of other tried-out and found
wanting thrills in easy energies. The star beautiful
had raised him to newer, grander speculation than the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page127" id="page127"></a>[pg&nbsp;127]</span>
things of earth conjured or the hope of forgiveness
promised. For every reach attained there must be
some effort put forward: for each sin committed an
atonement. Self pretending, by others accepted,
saviors and martyrs there had been many, but as time
went on one after another of these conjectured blessings
or blind experiments had been swept aside or
lost in the wake of a constantly progressive manhood,
at times cast high upon the billow&#146;s crest, again
sunken low into the troughs of despair, yet always
guided by a light that shone singly ahead, against
whose halo no discordant voice had as believed dimmed
or dulled the truer harmonies of an eternal, perfectly
consistent God.</p>
<p class="indent">Yodogima looked aloft and all around. Peace on
earth and good-will toward men whispered from every
nook and cranny. The birds sang it, the flowers
smelled it, the world looked consistent, but the heart
discerned a discordant note. Were death heaven&#146;s
only beginning, life&#146;s sole end? No, no; it must not
be, for I see with closed eyes, hear with muffled ears,
feel without the sense of touch a Kami, whose works
neither begin with worlds nor end in man; an illumination
extending from heaven unto earth. There is no
subtler hold than that we know; the things we see are
but the shades of reality. Truth vainly lives apart
and is infinite.</p>
<p class="indent">Sitting there enveloped, within a world as distinct
as sublime, as far above earth as its canopy is broad,
the mystic spell touched and warmed her as though
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page128" id="page128"></a>[pg&nbsp;128]</span>
its complement were at hand. The province of sex
fastened upon her as the sun&#146;s rays congeal and
expand with each unhindered contact: communing,
Yodogima had been less than human, had worse than
mocked His divinest precept, were the bread and wine
passed untasted.</p>
<p class="indent">Hideyoshi stood over, the world exacted its decrees,
and conformity offered her an only excuse:</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;I hear you,&#148; replied she, &#147;am conscious of my
obligations, and would not defy that is. Take me as
I am. I&#146;ll serve you if Kami commands; let the law
have its way, and make me what you like: in the name
of all that has gone before and that is to be, let me
and do you save, too, the honor of woman.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">That night the two-lipped cup once more went
round&mdash;its never-ending course&mdash;and Yodogima
became in law as she was in fact first of consequence
at Hideyoshi&#146;s court.</p>
<p class="indent">And if these things were inevitable, if there remained
at Azuchi a soul forlorn and perchance bitter,
perhaps welling up a still more ruthless indisposition,
and if the ideal toward which a hapless, helpless
woman had bent her every energy, sacrificed the body
to preserve a soul, were attained&mdash;if all this had resulted
in fact, there yet remained among them one in
whose heart there lingered not only a burning, compelling
sense of duty, but as well an abiding faith in
truth.</p>
<p class="indent">Yodogima had not surrendered the spirit, nor had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page129" id="page129"></a>[pg&nbsp;129]</span>
she submitted in pride, or bowed to falsehood, hate, or
weakness&mdash;to her the world seemed as sweet and as
wholesome as the battle had been swift or exacting.</p>
<p class="indent">Thence life portended a fullness that hitherto had
been a dream.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page130" id="page130"></a>[pg&nbsp;130]</span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>

<p class="indent">The great sacrifice that Yodogima made only
strengthened Hideyoshi&#146;s respect for her,
whetted the appetite to a keener appreciation of the
virtues underlying righteous generation. Ieyasu had
surrendered the heart to save his neck; no such thing
as pretence or any amount of subterfuge could deceive
the inner workings of an understanding wrought in
the light of penetration like Hideyoshi&#146;s. Yodogima
had reserved the heart, sacrificing personal predisposition
only that she might serve fairly the honor of
an under-sex&mdash;she had not submitted through compulsion
or fear of any man; the kwambaku knew that,
if others did not, and the very consciousness of it
made him what no earthly power could have done.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Such generosity,&#148; said he, to Oyea, in answer to
her questioning, &#147;cannot be requited so easily; there
must be a place set apart for them; perhaps among
the stars, and such as you and I can best attain our
peace in humbler ways&mdash;reverence has withstood the
storm of ages.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;But are not the gods self-asserted?&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Well, yes; I once thought so, perhaps do yet; but
self-assertion, not grounded upon self-denial, may
prove an empty blessing&mdash;as it has with me. Would
you profit by example, then look; even Hideyoshi has
found it meet that we reason together; who declares
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page131" id="page131"></a>[pg&nbsp;131]</span>
himself wiser than the humblest is in truth an ass;
deception cannot weather the test of time.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">They were sitting in the dusk, midway between day
and night, and arising, Hideyoshi approached the
family shrine&mdash;it seemed empty and so unlike the
needs of distinction, yet the kwambaku had, upon his
return from Odawara, stopped at Nakamura and done
reverence to his long buried but sadly neglected
parents. Nor had Nita (a first, but intractable, therefore
divorced, wife) been passed by without some
little recognition&mdash;possibly as an encouragement to
this one, Oyea, in this her most trying need.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;What of night following the day?&#148; asked he, of
her, lighting one, then the other of five carefully
selected and wistfully named sticks of incense for her
to sniff and guess or call as pleased her most and
fitted best his mood.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;That a sun may rise to outshine another,&#148; retorted
she, wholly mindful of her own situation, if not his
method.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;You say rightly, Oyea, and woe be unto him or
her who would deny or abuse the virtue of sniffing;
only through a son can man attain heaven.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">Hideyoshi&#146;s words pained Oyea; she had trusted
him, served dutifully, and conformed to the requirements
of the age, only to be told in the end that there
could be no salvation for her&mdash;the stork had withheld
her lord&#146;s divinest blessing.</p>
<p class="indent">Oyea looked round at the scant necessities with
which all her life she had been making both ends
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page132" id="page132"></a>[pg&nbsp;132]</span>
meet that he, her husband, should lack no aid within
her rendering to help him onward toward the goal
she, too, believed him most worthy to hold. Were
she to receive now, at the bidding of charm, or the
failure of chance, only the bare habiliments of respectable
doing? She had forfeited at marriage better
opportunity, suffered the finger of scorn more than
once, upheld patiently the laws of the land and bowed
reverently before the gods of time, and yet no one
had awakened within her a light revealing more than
earth&#146;s proffered bounty. And if the bitter must be
hers, why not as well partake of the sweets?</p>
<p class="indent">The very thought for the moment raised her from
lowest despondency to highest anticipation. Rising
to her feet the world seemed rejuvenated with a
thought as glorious as new&mdash;Hideyoshi lay stretched
upon the matting, snoring away fonder dreams than
she had dared conceive.</p>
<p class="indent">The cold sweat oozed in beads at her forehead.</p>
<p class="indent">Here, contentedly and at her mercy, rested in peace
and expectation the one who could at will and without
retribution give or take her happiness. Then
conscience rushed to the fore, and Oyea stood more
pitifully than purpose had made her. Calmly surveying
the relaxed features in whose justness had
been for a lifetime her only faith, the at last enraged
wife unwittingly loosed her would-be grasp in the
face of another vision which as incomprehensibly rose
to stay her hand.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Woman!&#148; snarled she, &#147;the curse of her kind, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page133" id="page133"></a>[pg&nbsp;133]</span>
a vexation always. I&#146;ll don another dress: therein lies
my only recompense.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">After a while Hideyoshi arose, and rubbing his eyes,
asked doubtfully:</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Did I sleep, Oyea?&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Yes, my lord.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Then it was a dream: I would that it were real.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;For that, it may be none the less.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">The great man looked up, puzzled though wilful.
He could, nor did, comprehend that she, too, might
have dreamed, marvelled the penalties exacted of
rightful living, and evolved a retribution, if less human,
then the more in keeping with an instinct born of
subtler virtues.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;You shall not deny me, Oyea?&#148; plead he, half
doubtful of the motive, if altogether innocent of her
intentions.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Deny you? Of what? Yodogima?&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;No. A son.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Aye, aye, my lord. A higher authority than mine
denies you that.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;There is none higher. You are my lawful wife.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Fie on you! We but declare, while impotency
reigns. My faith is in virtue.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Then I&#146;ll not trust you&mdash;though the bonzes had
served better, your purpose, than these self-called
priests: who preach to prey while their victims pray
but &#145;peach.&#146; I once had confidence in you: I never
had any in them.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;What of priests and bonzes, you might yet better
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page134" id="page134"></a>[pg&nbsp;134]</span>
charge a blessing to the care of one whose influence
nor beauty stands anyone in hand or harm: though
only a wife, I should serve no less an encouragement.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Rickety, rickety, fiddlede, fiddlede; a woman is a
woman, her tongue an appendage. Therein the certainty
of wagging. Both jealousy and consistency may
be jewels, superb and allusive, but each in a tiara. I&#146;ll
let you have it out in Azuchi; Yodogima is already
at Ozaka: between creeds, or independently, there
may yet formulate a crown. See you that your conduct
is no less attuned than her estimate deserves;
I have business at the capital.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">Taking his departure forthwith, Oyea bowed low
and reverently&mdash;not so much, perhaps, now, out of
respect for a husband alone, or for anything he had
done personally to deserve as much, but more as a
result of some inner quality or natural-born trait
that abuse could not eradicate or dull even into vain
misapprehension. Oyea was of better stock than
Hideyoshi: better insofar as tradition or probability
had seen fit to record and make known, yet looking
out upon the world in which she lived, and reflecting
the obligations imposed by a social organization with
which it seemed that she had had so little to do, a
growing sense of something wanting burned the harder
into her now softeningly bewildered consciousness.
Had she accused him wrongly? Might it be, after
all, verily some shortcoming of her own which had
for so long a time denied to him an inalienable right?
And what of society?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page135" id="page135"></a>[pg&nbsp;135]</span>
Her religion&mdash;that one handed down from an
ancestry antedating all creeds, surmounting any profession&mdash;had
provided the means of escaping just
such a failure as she, by virtue of feeling as pitted
against reason, had suffered; though as religiously, if
not as rigorously, courted. And why had she done
so?</p>
<p class="indent">The only reason that she could fairly call to mind
was that the priests had told her differently; that a
dawning trust in Christ was at that very moment
sapping the only foundation that she may have had
for a belief; that the doctrines of a new church were
separating her forever and helplessly from all that
had been dear and possible to her and hers&mdash;and,
asked she, of herself, and her God:</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;For what?&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">Oyea awaited patiently some response from this
newly proclaimed Savior, whom the priests had set
over her and home&mdash;no other voice than conscience
answered; and therein she conjured many thoughts,
divined a reason for things, and fell hopelessly at the
shrine of an uncontrollable, undenying, born-unto
impulse. Yodogima possessed an attraction, Kami in
his wisdom had equated life and death, and no man&#146;s
blood or woman&#146;s want could save a soul or regenerate
an unregenerate.</p>
<p class="indent">Then she marvelled the seeming vanity of all that
is more than crude, and out of the black there rushed
the possible saving grace of man&#146;s own involution-both
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page136" id="page136"></a>[pg&nbsp;136]</span>
prayer and confession had failed to wrest her
from worse than perdition.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;That woman enjoy my husband&#146;s favor, in a
castle of her own, because she is more than I? Hugh!
I&#146;ll see her humbled.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Otoshi?&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Yes, my lady.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Fetch the smelling-salts, and my vanity case.
Further, I shall not require your service, perhaps, till
the sun is risen&mdash;at Ozaka.&#148;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>

<p class="indent">The castle at Ozaka now stood in the main finished,
and with Yodogima&#146;s occupancy and
the kwambaku&#146;s favor at once sprang into prominence;
not only as a strategic point of first importance, but
as the very seat of empire socially, possibly politically,
rivaling in all respects, if not eclipsing, Kyoto, the
capital and ruling post since the days of Kwammu,
some eight hundred years before.</p>
<p class="indent">This tendency on the part of the barons, to centralize
all things at the new seat of power, did not
meet with Hideyoshi&#146;s broader views; he was democratic
at heart, and beside a better judgment may have
preferred &#147;toadyism,&#148; if such there must be, at long
range. He had fought his way into the foremost
rank, not to tear down existing institutions or to
substitute one man for another in authority or to
profit personally at the expense of others: he would
rise, no doubt to a heavenly sphere, but in that should
not disturb earthly conditions&mdash;it were the individual,
refractory and crude, who must be thrashed into
peaceful, tolerant attitudes&mdash;would carve out a new
place or adapt himself to an old one, enabling direction
and enforcement in a manner at once effective and
for the betterment of all mankind. A laudable thought,
perhaps, and with an organization in keeping with his
power to subjugate Hideyoshi might have become in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page138" id="page138"></a>[pg&nbsp;138]</span>
truth a god&mdash;self-made, self-standing, and self-perpetuating:
as he no doubt planned and fairly believed
within the doing of man.</p>
<p class="indent">Purposing to distribute and maintain separately
these greater divisions of human interest and essential
development, the kwambaku had as wisely or unwisely
sent Ieyasu into the newer regions at Tokyo,
hoping to transfer as far as possible from their capital,
not only a possible rival, but the larger business
activities of the empire; he had left the mikado, his
court and the kuge (royalty) at Kyoto, best fitted
as he believed by environment and tradition to perpetuate
authority on the one hand and engender
respect on the other; with religion or society in the
narrower sense he had little to do and much less concern:
both seemed essential or vital to priest or layman,
nobleman or peasant alike, hence the better
adapted without seat or prestige to encourage, less
deny; his own fortress he believed well established at
Ozaka.</p>
<p class="indent">Here he could look out, at close range, upon the
best that a nation had evolved or the worst suffered;
wealth and poverty were alike interesting and incumbent
questions. Strength within and weakness without
those walls afforded a contrast deep in purport.
To the southward, not far distant, lay Nara, treasured
home of the beautiful in art as well as the profound
of learning. Kyoto, the capital, no farther away,
sheltered the revered and the dignified in statesmanship
and authority. The trader&#146;s mart and the producer&#146;s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page139" id="page139"></a>[pg&nbsp;139]</span>
seat, least tasteful to him, had been transported
and established farthest off: intrusted to hands
that he believed best fitted for that and no other,
Hideyoshi sought to set himself down to the realization
of a larger desire, that other faith, the reincarnation,
an inter-perpetuation and glorification of self and self
alone.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;You are my only hope, Yodogima. Let faithfulness
adjust itself not to the exigencies of mean occasion,
but give me a son; the golden thread must be
stranded unbroken. Ishida shall serve, and the captains
honor; the wealth and the fashion and the culture
of all men henceforth bows at your bidding.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Do not tempt me, my lord; I should rather trust
Kami; the glitter but disheartens me: in prayer I have
faith.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;I would deny you nothing: only bear me a son.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Then grant me fair. Remove these fawning, cringing
courtiers, and bide you here; I am only human.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Perhaps more. Yet I&#146;ll vow you safe in hands I
know&mdash;Ishida never yet played me false. Come;
out with it; who is there, that you prefer? Hideyoshi
may wax blind, when occasion requires, but
he need not for that be treated as dumb&mdash;to the
workings of conscience or fancy. My wife loves: is
her husband but a scapegoat?&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;It may be true, and she none the less abused thus
accused. Take this man Ishida from the castle, and
keep him without. Perhaps then you shall know that
a woman may love and yet discern, if not command.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page140" id="page140"></a>[pg&nbsp;140]</span>
I am your wife, and shall serve you as decreed; a
chance is all that I shall ask or that you may require.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">Ashamed of his conduct and mortified over anxiety,
Hideyoshi did not as bid, but left the castle with his
suit, including the reluctant Ishida; who by long years
of faithful attendance had so ingratiated himself&mdash;designing
accordingly&mdash;that the kwambaku had already
been put to straits upon more than one occasion
to find a real or plausible excuse for keeping the
fellow longer in his service. Nor was Yodogima altogether
alone in her estimation of him; many of the
kwambaku&#146;s oldest and most trusted friends had suspicioned
the wily body-servant&#146;s good faith, in fact, at
this early day mistrusted ulterior motives and cross
purposes should the master accidentally or otherwise
happen to die.</p>
<p class="indent">The sudden departure, therefore, of Hideyoshi,
seemingly miffed and more than ever under the influence
of Ishida, who grew thereby less in favor among
the captains, roused some of them to greater concern,
if not about somebody&#146;s sanity, then as to their own
welfare.</p>
<p class="indent">Among these grizzled or enthusiastic warriors and
supporters none took to heart more than Kuroda the
matter of Hideyoshi&#146;s seeming change; the two had
grown up together, from early days, the one as retainer,
the other his aid, and they loved each other as
only men similarly situated and suited can love.
Ishida, however, had poisoned the elder, and with his
establishment at Fushima&mdash;selected on account of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page141" id="page141"></a>[pg&nbsp;141]</span>
its isolation yet accessibility&mdash;the veteran fighter,
Kuroda, was at last turned from the door.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;It is a terrible blow, Yodogima, to be torn from a
lifelong friendship,&#148; said he, to her, shortly afterward,
while sitting in the fall of evening, at the Ozaka
castle, overlooking the vast throngs around, who came
and went with less attending joy or sorrow, &#147;and
Ishida is to blame. Yet I cannot criticise your resolve;
you have fought a noble battle, my dear child:
you did right, and there isn&#146;t a man worth his while in
Hideyoshi&#146;s service but would stand by you to the last&mdash;I
wonder; has the kwambaku lost his mind?&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;No. He has, though, lost confidence in me,&#148; replied
Yodogima, suppressing with difficulty the tears
fast rising in her downcast eyes.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Impossible!&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;It is true.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Then Ishida has done more than play the traitor;
he has vilified a good woman: more, he has sought to
ruin a worthy wife. I swear it, he shall rue the day.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">In all these years Yodogima had done everything in
her power to live the life of a faithful, dutiful, and
appreciative wife&mdash;such as the law and the pleasure
of man had enforced. No longer might she question
the act, or consult morals; she had chosen to abide the
sterner edicts of a social organism utterly beyond the
revision or prevision of any one individual, much less
a woman: who had neither voice nor hand in the
making, nor could suggest its undoing. Yet the closer
the reality the more transcendant became her one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page142" id="page142"></a>[pg&nbsp;142]</span>
inspiration. The star that had guided her from infancy
shone the brighter for the gloom; that enshrouded
a heart, in which there lived a conscience:
the dictates of which had long ago flung her upon the
mercies of a less grinding, more tolerant fate.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;I will be true to my Kami, though declared false
by all the creeds of all the gods,&#148; promised she, to
herself, long after the grey-haired Kuroda had gone:
when the stars had inspired that larger comprehension
than of things we think we know.</p>
<p class="indent">The night brought, too, its peace of rest, and on the
morrow Yodogima awakened to a juster realization
of affairs close at hand; swift couriers brought tidings
of a great change at the seat of authority, Fushima&mdash;lately
established by Hideyoshi as his own official
residence, but just now turned over to Hidetsugu,
his nephew, whom he had adopted and made kwambaku,
he himself assuming the title of Taiko.</p>
<p class="indent">Scorn, therefore, began, presently, to take the place
of due consideration; rumor travelled fast, and the
master&#146;s change of title, and the adoption of an heir,
soon raised the question of failure: Yodogima was
now charged with vilest remission, and had not resignation
sooner prepared the way she, too, must have
fallen before the rank avalanche of duller ingratitude
than follows in the wake of blind assumption.</p>
<p class="indent">The nation had been wronged, and the man who had
placed his trust in her, abused: it devolved upon her
and none other to right the grievous evil that had
apparently been accepted as final.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page143" id="page143"></a>[pg&nbsp;143]</span>
&#147;What in His name can I do?&#148; begged and plead
the princess, in the only way that she knew.</p>
<p class="indent">Then Oyea stealthily came to Ozaka, advising and
befriending.</p>
<p class="indent">The older of the two wives did not threaten; she
had learned by experience and conversion that the
more effective course lay in subtler means, perhaps in
truth.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Why don&#146;t you visit Hiyeisan? There is a temple
there&mdash;&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;I thought you had turned Christian?&#148; interceded
Yodogima, thoughtlessly.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;So I have; but you may need not some forgiveness;
circumstance no sooner governs than fulfilment
predicates&mdash;the act, if not our meed. What matter
how or where we pray and do, when wrought in
heaven&#146;s likening span? It is the consequence, and
not its revelation, that makes duty paramount. Therefore,
seek you, who have only to choose; it is for such
as I to fashion, and when this particular god shall
have served you as he never did me, why, then, you,
too, may have occasion to flit and none to reason. I
tell you there are as many ways as creeds, or less, and
I&#146;d try them out, all of them, though not so beautiful.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">Yodogima laughed outright in spite of conditions:</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;What in heaven&#146;s name has beauty to do with
religion?&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;My dear Yodogima; it has everything to do with
it; as it has to do with all things and everybody, the
gods, their churches, and our bounties included. Do
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page144" id="page144"></a>[pg&nbsp;144]</span>
you suppose, for a minute, that I should be here,
to-day, were it not for you? And it&#146;s a part of my
religion to serve and trust that trust may serve.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;How kind!&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;You won&#146;t fail me, will you, Yodogima?&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;I&#146;ll think about it; I do not wish to be narrow, or&mdash;outwitted.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">An unlooked-for restlessness appeared to have
swept into the land; and all the barons and captains
grew uneasy with inaction or impatient of conditions.
To Yodogima it seemed that in some way she alone
were responsible for the cause, if not the effect, of
such unheard-of conditions. Hideyoshi knew better;
and smarting with shame or repenting of foolhardiness
turned again toward Ozaka.</p>
<p class="indent">No such joy had come to Yodogima since the day
Ieyasu promised his love and protection. While
Oyea had never broken faith, and still professed
friendship, the younger wife had long ago amply discovered
the reason, and knew fairly in her own heart
that once a wife in fact no husband might share his
love or respect or favor without breaking the tenderer
thread, no matter what the demands or the edicts of
society and of law, or both. Whether for good or for
ill there could be no compromise where an affinity
had laid its hand upon that and that alone vital, if not
sacred, unto itself. The older wife&#146;s interest had
resolved only the shielding of an inner vanity, as Hideyoshi&#146;s
accusations laid bare the outward appearance
of that same inborn, unmanageable tendency: call it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page145" id="page145"></a>[pg&nbsp;145]</span>
by what name one might, govern as the world should
see fit, it were yet a force no less determinate of man
than absolute in the revelation of God.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;I did you a very great wrong,&#148; began Hideyoshi,
by way of remission, as Yodogima and he strolled
away, through the bramble, at the hillside, toward the
lower castle wall; &#147;and, as you see, in recognition of
your superior trust and my acknowledged duty, I
have willingly left Ishida behind. What more would
you have me do, lady patience?&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Love me, truly love me, my lord; then, also, you
might, sometimes, address me, as Yodogima&mdash;only
Yodogima, if no more.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;And, will you, too, call me Hideyoshi?&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">Yodogima bowed low, and the scarlet rushed to her
face. The soft, warm air of early spring fanned the
flame, and Hideyoshi felt as never before the glow
and the warmth of rising confidence. An image
carved in stone of the good and the great stood near
at their side and returning the cherished salutation
of that one higher held our taiko for the first time
in his life approached this in some way fashioned
god who had for many thousand or more years held
and swayed the hearts of a nation so deep-grounded
and far-seeing that no truth revealed or possibility
conjectured had escaped their discerning, eager quest
for that we wish were what we would it were. And
approaching, he did the one thing that really distinguishes
man and establishes for him a world apart.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page146" id="page146"></a>[pg&nbsp;146]</span>
Hideyoshi prayed; and Yodogima marvelled the
force of an environment.</p>
<p class="indent">All her prayers had arisen within the solicitude of
tried-out conviction, a consciousness fraught with distrust
in everything not wholly proven or self-satisfying,
were invoked of a Being that she knew, One
standing revealed in the light of His beneficence, not
some unknown but hoped-for God, conjured as the
result of a longing on her part to escape the heartless
dark of earth&#146;s vain, momentary alternations. Follow
that beacon&mdash;above the need or beneath the power
of faith&mdash;she would; there could be no doubt in her
mind as to His supremacy, Its ultimatum; but might
she not for that, without overstepping the borders of
a bidden track, nor any the less losing sight of her own
true inspiration, might she not, in her flight toward
an unalterably preconceived and self-attainable end
so govern her steps that no conflict ensue with others
bent on no less holy, yet more uncertain, grounds?</p>
<p class="indent">The stars seemed whirling in space measured and
adjusted to the balance of a perfect equilibrium; all
the elements, no matter whether it be the rushing of
the winds, or the rumblings of an avalanche, or the
belching forth of fire and the downpourings of waters
from heaven upon earth, each found in due time and
with perfect accord its own properly allotted place or
plan; the soul and the body lived their destined duality
with no more positive dissolution than death itself
scarce renders; the negative forces of earth and eternity,
heaven or oblivion, were but the positive&#146;s own
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page147" id="page147"></a>[pg&nbsp;147]</span>
postulate, working out its never-ending, all-propelling
grind toward an essential individuality, supreme and
overreaching, whether wrought in the fiery evolutions
of fate or suffered of an humbler, more easily gotten,
commonly adapted belief, its godhead a trinity or as
we please, and its doctrine but a faith or something
less: why deny anything, anybody, or their pleasure?</p>
<p class="indent">Jokoin had fully demonstrated the larger possibilities
of any ordinary sort of real susceptibility, Oyea
had suggested the temple as a more fitting place, and
a particular one as the most likely of transmission if
not remission, and Hideyoshi really made no outward
protest against its individual use or secular purposes:
there must be some strange potency hidden underneath
the force of prayer wafted within the portals
of a place guarded so sacredly and approached in faith.
The church too, then, either temple or edifice, held
its secret, perchance worked an instrumentality, no
doubt brought compensations that she, in her lone
environment, had failed to realize: the world demanded
of her that she leave no thing undone, make
every effort to resolve its higher blessing, and through
that and that alone she must and could attain her own
true ideality.</p>
<p class="indent">Hideyoshi had, for all she knew or could surmise,
done his part and faithfully.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;You have now my very soul, Yodogima, and are
proffered as well its beggarly hull. All these trappings,
with which I have fairly endowed you&mdash;a
castle not made with common hands, the finest silks
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page148" id="page148"></a>[pg&nbsp;148]</span>
evolved of Uena&#146;s grace, food that no god might disdain,
and service from no lesser educator than time
itself&mdash;are nothing as compared with the spirit I
would invoke. Hear me, O Benten, O Yodogima, O
Eternity; I must have life, shall survive the grave.
Grant me this, mother of time, goddess on earth, and
love to men; I can do no more; the blood of man is
final; it is supreme, an only offering. Let me survive,&#148;
begged Hideyoshi, utterly oblivious of anything
and everything, except the one woman who stood
over with anxious, motionless face.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;It shall be done,&#148; replied she, not any less driven
or conscious of the broad seas of uncertainty raising
and lowering their frail bark upon its never ceasing,
always mysterious trend or disregarding travail.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>

<p class="indent">Long into the night Yodogima struggled hard
with the problem which now crowded closer
round, hemming her in and forcing her down till there
seemed no other means of escape. Their own religion
promised no relief short of the phenomenal, and her
husband had made a last appeal: would again tear
himself away, going this time into foreign lands, thus
to retrieve his fallen prestige with further deadly
conflict.</p>
<p class="indent">Something must be done; and that quickly, as circumstances
indicated; the recently subdued daimyos,
though loyal, were veterans, and out of employment,
became unmanageable; using, no doubt, the matter
of the taiko&#146;s failure of a natural son as an excuse
themselves to break the peace. Korea, therefore, offered
a likely outlet, and thither her husband should
go, yet it must take many months to equip and move
such an army as he had threatened upon so hazardous
an undertaking. Yodogima reasoned that she still
had time to save him and reestablish confidence at
home.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;I shall in truth try the temple,&#148; concluded she, to
herself, &#147;as this meddlesome Oyea&mdash;I fear with more
of knowledge than faith&mdash;has so earnestly and Christianly-like
advised. Perhaps creed, after all, is verily
some real man-made, opportunely-devised opening
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page150" id="page150"></a>[pg&nbsp;150]</span>
unto the Way. I must, however, accept faith, as a
guide, more upon the strength of Jokoin&#146;s fain attitude;
she seems to have gotten for the trouble all she
asked or could manage. This Christian device, though
new and undemonstrable, if it does no more, may be
the means of revealing to me a bit of the benefaction
that some of our fathers profess these six hundred
years or more to have found hidden behind the benignity
of Buddha. Yes, I shall just this once, if not
again, set aside staid reason to test dame truth, deny
self at the bidding and for the love of others&mdash;the
effect can be no more trying than the cause is just.
My prayer must be answered.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">Thus convinced and resigned, sleep, peaceful and
converting, brought in its round at waking a hope that
held hitherto only in the making. Now she could look
out upon the world with a freedom that brooked no
questioning: the very clouds themselves seemed
fraught with a charity that she had believed the part
and the due of man alone. No longer need she concern
herself about sin; the blood of a savior had atoned
that: Buddha made it plain that knowledge is the way,
and men, inspired no doubt, had built a temple,
sacredly ruled at the door.</p>
<p class="indent">She had, only, to proceed thither, and pray.</p>
<p class="indent">Yodogima really held fast at heart a true conversion;
the same ideal shone as brightly as before; only
the means had shifted; let them smite; she should
turn the other cheek.</p>
<p class="indent">And they did strike. Long before Hideyoshi had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page151" id="page151"></a>[pg&nbsp;151]</span>
tried out or finished his advantage, Oyea clandestinely
entered the temple and there counselled the keeper&mdash;she
had known him for a long time, and designed
better than he knew or Yodogima anticipated.</p>
<p class="indent">The morning wended brightly, and the confiding
princess, departing tenderly the vain, mute welcomings
of an ardently-inclined, hard-accepted husband,
trod expectantly toward the selfsame edifice, devised
and made in the name of One who consoles, be it man
or his cold-striven image.</p>
<p class="indent">Two lions carved in stone stood sentinel at either
side the entrance. These Yodogima contemplated in
the light of a new understanding, born not of tradition,
but of faith proclaimed and knowledge derived.
She stood there in the footprints of an enforced progression,
and must no longer question dogma, though
God be greater. Then she turned toward the gate,
frosted with antiquity and jealous of its passage&mdash;a
receptacle midway standing glaringly reminded her of
a duty that fortunately she had remembered: Yodogima,
too, cast her bread upon the waters, and passed
on, that others might feast as she did penance.</p>
<p class="indent">Intercepted now by grated screens, warning her
that she must ask and it shall be given, Yodogima
looked and there beheld an image, a true likeness of
what she all her life had painted sublime. Neither
male nor female, but of wood, carved in lines more
symmetrical than reality had effected, lacquered of
gold finer than the wants of ordinary man had ever
acclaimed, these surrounded with safeguards seemingly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page152" id="page152"></a>[pg&nbsp;152]</span>
beyond human invasion, guarded on either side
by emblems without either beginning or ending, all
surmounted in a halo that two burning pots of incense
ceaselessly wafted thither, this Yodogima, a penitent,
believed with the spirit of one who would suffer no
transgression to stay or hinder any fulfilment that
her God might elect, and clapping her hands as inwardly
decreed and outwardly expressed through time
hoary invoked a passage no less distant or angelic than
others perhaps as discerning or more plastic, of ages
recurring and lands apart, had sought or denied in the
lesser stranding of a course no more divinely conceived.</p>
<p class="indent">No further or greater low proving and encouraging
of an inspiration born within, and the spit-ball propitiously
thrown&mdash;not with vulgar meaning&mdash;the gates
on either side the lofty emblem swung ajar&mdash;Yodogima
had gained the promise of an inner sanctuary,
where moods and morals are the more finely, if not
subtly, wrought and there dwells no other god or goddess
than communion withal.</p>
<p class="indent">Yodogima chose the right approach and her prognosticator
the left. As an affinity draws, so it resolves
only the transverse of an attending unity. The positive
and the negative harmonize upon grounds no
more irreducible, and that bonze followed his prey
as the quadrant confronts a Cardan.</p>
<p class="indent">Lying there, at one side, behind closed doors, his
own view unobstructed, this godly man, with the aid
of Oyea, a Christian accomplice&#146;s assurances, had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page153" id="page153"></a>[pg&nbsp;153]</span>
penetrated deeper than the veil donned in faith gained
and worn as a security provisioned, and discerning
the motive augured a fulfilment that Yodogima alone
had striven for in vain.</p>
<p class="indent">Once inside the four walls of this more than sacred,
an over-beautiful, a divinely wrought, and suggestively
potent place, our vainly beguiled and no less
hard-pressed princess dropped hopelessly to her knees
and gazing round saw no other thing than one bewilderingly
done round and covering of modestly drawn
yet bewitchingly significant prisms or reflections that
led apparently to or from nowhere, yet emanating in or
symbolizing afar the one ideal that had lured her
thither.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;At last!&#148; whispered she, as the sun above gathered
and mellowed, merging and intertwining the fanciful
and the real, till comprehension ceased and ideality
carried her aloft the world she knew.</p>
<p class="indent">Only the soft matting underneath served her now
prostrate form; the spirit ceased its aching quest: a
reality bordering the extremes of ethereal generation
possessed her. The great sun seemed marshaling its
hosts. Glad bugles sounded. A myriad cupids, winged
as doves and armed with bows and arrows, balanced
and made ready for the flight. The great father of
fathers reached into his mighty knapsack, and Yodogima
breathed sparingly lest he withdraw empty the
hand she longed to realize filled. The good benefactor
smiled, and that she sorrow no more revealed to her
the jewel&mdash;it was a son. And as the troopers charged
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page154" id="page154"></a>[pg&nbsp;154]</span>
earthward, their purpose revealing itself in every
fiber, the glad tidings of a fulfilment worthy and complete
filling her to overflowing, Yodogima opened
wide her eyes, and&mdash;Katsutoya stood over her.</p>
<p class="indent">Her dream, then, was in truth an unthinkable reality:
faith, as designed, a pregnant hoax.</p>
<p class="indent">Words were worse than useless now, and the body
as helpless; thus Yodogima only stared, the harder:
with one furtive glance Katsutoya read her innermost
thoughts, and flushing to the full bent his knee with
partings still baser:</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Trust me, Yodogima: henceforth I am Harunaga.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">Yodogima did not attempt to answer her traducer,
who departed as he had entered, professing the bestowal,
only, of mercies latent underneath the sackcloth
and of the beadroll. She lay submerged now;
overweighted with a fantasy as far beneath the earth
she abode as fancy had heretofore carried her above
it. Darkness came on, tremors marked some hard internal
disturbance, while yawning caverns fumed and
spat fiery bursts and sulphurous clouds from the
mountain away. The infernal possessed her. A huge
dragon, half within, half without, at the summit, coiling
and straightening, lifting and lowering, seeking and
searching, here and there, all around, to the horizon,
at last found her out, and mounting its slender neck,
with no hold to retain her balance, the monster, rising
with her, curved easily round and, retracing its slimy
part, disappeared into the uttermost depths of hades
itself.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page155" id="page155"></a>[pg&nbsp;155]</span>
And there Ono Harunaga sweat and forked at
building the fires. Great heaps of humans replenished
the fuel bins. These Yodogima scanned with
eagerness: many faces seemed familiar, but always
before she could come close enough to determine certainly
who the victim was, Harunaga had snatched
away and pitched him into the flames beyond her
reach or discernment. Which eager haste seemed
quite unreasonable to her, but upon questioning him
he answered resolutely as of old:</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Have faith in&mdash;&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">Yodogima did not exactly catch the last word in his
reply, but she could not believe it &#147;Christ&#148; or
&#147;Buddha&#148; or &#147;Confucius,&#148; or any like name that she
knew, because the furnace fender were himself a
reverend man. No Shinto patron had been named;
these were gods: the antithesis of Saviors, hence in
fact and not on trust.</p>
<p class="indent">Once she thought she saw her father, but upon
closer scrutiny discerned this victim&#146;s plight to be in
consequence of the vain ambitions of three unfaithful
daughters, hence knew that she must have mistaken
him. This almost inexcusable blunder shocked her
severely, and to avoid any further unpleasantness of
that sort Yodogima determined, as she were there, to
do as others did; disguise her own true self, and rely
wholly upon deception to carry her forward thence in
the quest of all things hellish. Therefore she began
ignoring the individual, and continued considering
altogether the classes; and as there appeared to be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page156" id="page156"></a>[pg&nbsp;156]</span>
only one such there, she hit upon the plan of segregating
Harunaga&#146;s vast unrealized mass of strident
humans by considering more their color. And here,
too, distinguishment proved difficult, though there
appeared to be, distinctly, some awful difference in
the flame if white fuel were added, or the reverse.
The former flared more fiercely, burned the less willingly,
and their screams&mdash;</p>
<p class="indent">Rising to her feet and looking round at the barren
walls yet enclosing her, Yodogima realized for the
first time that what we think we see is but the shadow
of an energy stupidly awaiting over there the magic
wand here to unfold.</p>
<p class="indent">Intelligence had wrought a true womanhood.</p>
<p class="indent">But invoke it, and the world itself were a fairyland&mdash;let
gods be gods and the rest each his allotted part
endure. She would live down the sin of beguiling,
and bring to earth with ambition&#146;s might the heaven
she had fancied above.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>

<p class="indent">With her eyes thus opened, Yodogima had resolved,
perhaps too quickly, most likely altogether
out of proportion to existing capacities, for
Japan withal Hideyoshi&#146;s democratic tendencies had
not then come to recognize woman as a factor in the
determining of codes or the framing of morals. True,
women had progressed, side by side with their gallants,
down through all the chivalrous Ashikaga centuries,
but only in a passive way. She yet carried the
shackles inherited of Jingo&#146;s daring audacity, and
none had risen to do more than suffer the penalties
exacted of a confiding and repentant, if jealous, half
in kind. Yodogima, though convinced of its susceptibility
on the one hand and pother on the other, would
not concede that sex were or could be made a lasting
turnstile, through which to thresh or encourage
humans.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;They have tricked and robbed, now coerce me,&#148;
reasoned she, to herself, the while groping her way
and pondering the consequences, upon that dark,
quiet night, toward the home she had earlier left unstained
and in faith. &#147;Man, no less his better half,
is a brute; born of lust and scarce started on the Way.
His heart&mdash;ah! there lies the secret, herein uncoils
a thread, and I&#146;ll begin it all over again by attempting
to rewind the broken strands of my little life&mdash;in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page158" id="page158"></a>[pg&nbsp;158]</span>
manner of their own eternally begotten process. Deception
only may be sinful, while failure we know to
be hailed not as a virtue. Success, oh, so divine! I
think I know you now, whereas before I&#146;ve only
dreamed.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">Upon reaching the castle, much excitement prevailed.
Though the morning was yet early, troops
were on the move, and where hitherto peace had held
all at last seemed making ready for some big, uncertain
undertaking. Kuroda had been relieved of duty
there and sent to the front. All the faithful were
withdrawn and Christians placed in stead to guard
the gates in front: Kitagira left in charge, Hideyoshi
had gone elsewhere, thus relieving Yodogima of the
probability of any immediate contact.</p>
<p class="indent">Shut up alone at the castle, relieved of the embarrassment
auguring in Kuroda&#146;s presence, or others of
the old school, whom she could scarce resist, and surrounded
with a guard more in keeping with her necessities,
if not motive, Yodogima planned afresh, as
hitherto she had only hoped.</p>
<p class="indent">In time, as well, her face brightened, for Jokoin
had come to remain with her during Hideyoshi&#146;s
absence, and sooner married to Kyogoku, of course,
between the two of them there should be little doubt
about rendering the taiko a son. Only time hung
heavily upon her hands; no such preparations had
been made within the memory of man as that waged
against innocent Korea. Hideyoshi had demanded of
them that they join him in no less an undertaking
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page159" id="page159"></a>[pg&nbsp;159]</span>
than the conquest of mighty China, and refusing had
thrown his forces against them, first to compel their
aid, and secondly to open the doors to that larger
ambition of his, looked upon by all alike as hardly
more than mad.</p>
<p class="indent">A formidable army it was, too, that he had gotten
together, in three divisions, dispatching one under
the command each of Kato Kiyomasa and Konishi
Yukinaga&mdash;with Ukita Hidaye in higher authority&mdash;holding
the other in reserve at Nagoya, on the western
coast of Kyushu; where Hideyoshi himself had
established headquarters, the better to direct supreme
control.</p>
<p class="indent">Thirst for gain, now, had won the support of every
daimyo in the land; the loyal and the disgruntled alike;
of which he had advised Yodogima, fully, at their last
meeting&mdash;the possible consequence startling her into
the making of any sacrifice to save him.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;My power over others has been gained by the
sword,&#148; argued he, &#147;because of selecting well and bestowing
better: to the victor belongs the spoils, and
greed once the encouragement there is no end; I must
seek further resources elsewhere than at home; this
field is exhausted; the cry for an heir is but the prelude
to gold&mdash;and why fret my life away mourning
the failure of a son? China is worth while and Hideyoshi
its greater.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">The fire flashed as of old in his eyes, but Yodogima
knew better the heart&mdash;nor had Esyo misjudged
the elder sister&#146;s influence or the position promising.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page160" id="page160"></a>[pg&nbsp;160]</span>
Hideyoshi had quelled the mob, but failed at organization:
should any such vital realization be let to stand
Yodogima in hand? Ought her sister, though older
and &#147;more handsome,&#148; be permitted to indulge undying
fame, while she, if younger, yet &#147;her superior,&#148;
remain just an unthanked adviser to a daimyo like
Ieyasu? Not if she could prevent it.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Accept of this invitation, from Hideyoshi, to join
them, in the plundering of others&mdash;though you have
no need or desire for booty,&#148; urged Esyo, advising
Ieyasu, her guardian. &#147;It may be the means of proving
what I have contended these many years, and
Ieyasu&mdash;greater than Hideyoshi&mdash;may yet see his
way clear, or father somehow the conscience, to make
Esyo&mdash;worthier than Yodogima&mdash;his wife.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">Ieyasu pondered, possibly frowned: still waited.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Get as close as you can, to this monkey-faced tyrant,&#148;
continued she, &#147;and some unlooked-for riddance
may discreetly arise. On the way, I shall, with
your permission, pay Yodogima a visit: I think I can
unearth the likelihood: her scheme we already know.
You are rich and powerful now; Yedo has thrived
beyond their knowledge, though Hideyoshi is said once
upon a time to have seen without eyes. I tell you, the
Tokugawa (Ieyasu&#146;s family: its name) is a possibility.
Trust me, Ieyasu; will you not, just this
once?&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">Ieyasu hesitated, yet waited. True he had risen
to the topmost rank as a daimyo, outstripping any
other in wealth and strength, but this he believed due
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page161" id="page161"></a>[pg&nbsp;161]</span>
more to his own patient plodding and dogged persistence
than to what with Esyo&#146;s brilliant scheming
and multitudinous plans. Still he respected her; perhaps
because Yodogima, however set aside, had constantly
borne deeper into his affections; Saji proved
a bore, from the start, as expected, and Esyo&#146;s mentality,
always agreeable, failed of heart. A deeper
interest gripped him, would not let go, but wait he
must.</p>
<p class="indent">Those cold, hard-studied assurances, not flattery,
of Esyo&#146;s, did not, however, displease Ieyasu. Yet
they failed to move him; and when he did, at last,
start on that journey, which was forever to open his
eyes to larger contemplation, it had been on other
grounds; Ieyasu feared Hideyoshi; he dared not disregard
the command, and went as others did: to save
their necks, and reap the beggarly bounty gratuitously
suffered.</p>
<p class="indent">Once at Nagoya, however, Hideyoshi&#146;s temporary
headquarters, Ieyasu again rapidly rose in favor;
he apparently had no axe of his own to grind, and
the taiko believed him capable.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;I shall leave you in charge, at home, and myself
cross the channel, into Korea,&#148; threatened Hideyoshi,
upon receipt of bad news from the field; &#147;this Hidaye
is making a mess of it, and what is left of the advance
shall have more need of my presence, before the river
Ta-dong is crossed and Chinese soil has inspired them
to renewed effort. Do you accept this responsibility
of a free will?&#148;</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page162" id="page162"></a>[pg&nbsp;162]</span>
Possibly Hideyoshi had sooner surmised, hence
inquired the truth, for Ieyasu again hesitated; he
had previously counselled with Oyea, and now possessed
fresh intelligence at Esyo&#146;s hands.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Let him go,&#148; proposed she; and, if he had gone,
Yodogima&#146;s further troubles were saved&mdash;not, it is
true, as Esyo planned.</p>
<p class="indent">Upon visiting Yodogima, as permitted, Esyo had
found not only the one but the other of her sisters
there&mdash;portending, to her way of thinking, somewhat,
if not dreadfully, suspicious circumstances.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;How you look, Yodogima; and Jokoin, too. I am
awfully surprised. Is it really true&mdash;and how? Oyea
just said that Hideyoshi&mdash;and I promised not to tell.
How stupid I am! Of course Jokoin might be expected&mdash;but
Yodogima! How dare you trust yourself
to the wiles of these Christians? Why, they are
even, at the gate. I hope you have not the courage
to permit their coming closer? And my gown; perhaps
they have already soiled this very mat? I think
I must be going&mdash;you have, I&#146;m sure, observed the
make and the fineness of it? Ieyasu gave it to me,
in anticipation of our marriage&mdash;and we had thought
of inviting you, just to see our home, but&mdash;these
Christians! I never could bear the thought&mdash;good-bye&mdash;I
must be going&mdash;you have my best wishes&mdash;good-bye.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">Yodogima and Jokoin only stared at each other;
Esyo had come upon them with no more ceremony
than at departing, and they were puzzled to know the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page163" id="page163"></a>[pg&nbsp;163]</span>
meaning of her unexpected visit: the younger of the
two may have marvelled the audacity of her bearing;
it is certain that the eldest had good reason to question
the truthfulness of her statement, and did.</p>
<p class="indent">At Azuchi, Esyo had fared or demeaned herself
differently. Both she and Ieyasu had called there,
by invitation&mdash;contemplated, no doubt, on both sides&mdash;and
Oyea, alone and undisturbed, took great pains
to advise the latter, to the former&#146;s entire satisfaction,
of some things that were, if to be seen, only too
patent; also, of many that were perhaps in truth the
creatures of her imagination or purpose. She had
said nothing of Yodogima&#146;s venturing to the temple,
though she knew, to say the least, that she had been
there&mdash;a circumstance, in itself, to be jealously
guarded; particularly as indited of discretion or necessity,
possibly both; Ieyasu, at all events, would brook
no tampering with the Buddha as adapted, for all his
research, into the religions of the world, especially
Confucianism, had only grounded him the firmer.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;It is this Christian influence that plays havoc at
Ozaka,&#148; promised she, to Ieyasu, who had risen to
depart for the West. &#147;They are in evidence, if not
of authority&mdash;I won&#146;t accuse Yodogima; she is too
discreet&mdash;at the castle, and as sure as I live they
are in command at the front! I do believe Hideyoshi
has fairly gone mad.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Are you not a convert? I was informed that you
were,&#148; ventured Ieyasu.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;True, I was; therefore might be given credit for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page164" id="page164"></a>[pg&nbsp;164]</span>
knowing whereof I speak. And more, let Hideyoshi
substitute my nephew, Kobayakawa Hideki, one of
our kind, for that outcast convert, Hidaye, his Korean
field marshal, and Ieyasu shall not suffer, I promise
you, therefor.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">Going his way, without further parley or consultation
about propriety, fully confirmed in and satisfied
with his own views, concerning the priesthood, and
Christianity in general, Ieyasu cogitated alarm; the
new religion&#146;s hold upon the government, slight as it
was, as yet, or its influence over the taiko, if any&mdash;a
thing he very much doubted&mdash;could be, easily
enough, as he thought, stayed or disposed, but Yodogima!
How, then, could he save her?</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;But why bother about it? She is nothing to me,
and, come to think, it might be best, as urged, to
marry Esyo, and make an end of it. I&#146;ll test Hideyoshi,
however, before committing myself,&#148; threatened
he, hastening toward the end of his journey,
there to spy rather than serve, while Esyo schemed,
no more discreetly, at the capital.</p>
<p class="indent">As it turned out, there proved no need of his
waiting, this time, as concerned, however, only the
witnessing of results; the test had been, to his surprise,
occasioned fairly beforehand: from an unexpected
source, as well, hence doubly instructive. Jokoin
had before this, as might have been anticipated,
connived the assistance of Yodogima in exacting from
Hideyoshi permission for the return to Japan, and
their settlement at Nagasaki, near Hideyoshi&#146;s present
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page165" id="page165"></a>[pg&nbsp;165]</span>
headquarters, of the priests; who had been, sometime
before, expelled for acts of intolerance and violence&mdash;such
as the burning of temples and the killing
of bonzes, and others whom they could not convert
and dared molest&mdash;that had unquestionably settled
for once and for all, in the mind of every loyal subject,
the temper of these godly men and as well the
drift of their converted allies.</p>
<p class="indent">This sudden turnover of Hideyoshi&#146;s startled Ieyasu;
he could not account for it, not knowing the
source, and Yodogima held her counsel as well as
Jokoin&#146;s. She had a part of her own to play now,
and may have served some deeper purpose than a
sister&#146;s sympathetic whim by temporizing for the moment
with an ousted sect more at variance from her
own views than any other hitherto attempted importation
by upstart or trader. At all events they came,
and their apparent entireness of reinvestiture at once
paralyzed further conjecture.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;So this is the kind of keep the taiko would assign
me?&#148; queried Ieyasu, of Asano Nagamasa, a friendly
co-supporter. &#147;Most likely, between two such
fires, a Christian propaganda and an infidel ruler,
Ieyasu, his professed friend, might well be rid. I
shall not remain: we must devise some means.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Hideyoshi is mad,&#148; replied Nagamasa, in a high
voice and nervous manner.</p>
<p class="indent">An attendant, within hearing, forthwith reported
this last speech to his master, Hideyoshi: a hubbub
ensued, and no further occasion became necessary to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page166" id="page166"></a>[pg&nbsp;166]</span>
warrant their remaining at home; Nagamasa was sent
to his fief in disgrace, and Ieyasu questioned.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;There is a lesson that we should heed in this accusation
by Nagamasa; who loves you as he does his
life; the barons have been, as you well know, subjected
by force, and with the master gone out of the
country they should be ill content to wear the yoke:
Ieyasu is not the man to do Hideyoshi&#146;s work,&#148;
argued Ieyasu, to Hideyoshi, discreetly: with a purpose
and an estimation not wholly made known.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;What you say is true, but I shall go; I have better
counsel,&#148; retorted Hideyoshi, not the least bit perturbed
at heart or altered in purpose by his antagonist&#146;s
insinuations.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Yes; at Ozaka. As you have, also, the prospect
of an heir,&#148; ventured Ieyasu, conserving well an
only opportunity.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;What?&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;It is as I say.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Then you are a better man than I; I did not know
as much.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Thank you,&#148; replied Ieyasu, not any the more disconcerted
by the master&#146;s thrust.</p>
<p class="indent">Hideyoshi for once looked Ieyasu squarely in the
eyes.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Well?&#148; inquired the underling, boldly.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;If you have spoken truly&mdash;your fortune is made;
if not&mdash;I shall send you to Korea,&#148; replied Hideyoshi,
composedly.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page167" id="page167"></a>[pg&nbsp;167]</span>
&#147;Then&mdash;I am a made man,&#148; retorted Ieyasu,
seemingly settled upon some sort of true conviction.</p>
<p class="indent">Interpreting Ieyasu&#146;s last remark in the most favorable
light, as always done, when possible, Hideyoshi&#146;s
enthusiasm waxed significantly, if unexpectedly
afresh. At last Ieyasu, by a ruse, had done
something more than wait; the Chinese fantasy had
been brought suddenly to a halt, and Japan saved
probable humiliation, to say nothing of absolute defeat;
Hidaye had already been all but crushed, and
that, too, without getting beyond the confines of weak,
unprepared, and unwarlike Korea. Had Hideyoshi
himself left Japanese soil, with his contemplated reserve
force, the trap laid by the wily Chin Ikei, China&#146;s
over-matching envoy, might have defeated more
potent, if less fantastic, ambitions even than Hideyoshi&#146;s.</p>
<p class="indent">None, but one, knew better than Ieyasu the futility
of the taiko&#146;s foreign project, nor was he any the
less positive whom that might be, or of her desperate
struggle against almost certain disaster: yet he believed
Hideyoshi the father of her child, and bided
thence patiently the further exactions of an inner
conscience.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;She is both worthy and capable,&#148; reasoned he, to
himself, contentedly, &#147;and I shall henceforth follow
in the wake of an ambition higher than mine, more
tolerable than Hideyoshi&#146;s.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">Maeda Toshiye left in charge, the taiko forthwith
abandoned forever the camp at Nagoya, and hastening
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page168" id="page168"></a>[pg&nbsp;168]</span>
to Ozaka found Yodogima ill prepared to receive
him. He had come unbidden, and demanding entrance
to her boudoir, was denied: Hideyoshi fumed and
stormed. Ishida, however, calmed him; he, too, had
found it convenient or desirable to court favor and
spy out an advantage there, and Kyogoku alone had
been the means of his coming; Jokoin had also denied
him, her husband, any sort of entrance&mdash;thus Ishida
had been privileged happily to win as well as serve the
good will also of Yodogima.</p>
<p class="indent">Seven days had elapsed, and in that time Ishida
proved himself not only a master of ceremonies but a
diplomat to be reckoned with thereafter; both Hideyoshi
and Yodogima, presumably from different standpoints,
recognized the service, and though absent,
Ieyasu no doubt had ample occasion to surmise the
rapid rising of an influence hitherto not at all suspected.</p>
<p class="indent">The days, however, passed quietly, and presently
the door to the taiko&#146;s chamber slid back gently and
unobserved. Hideyoshi sat with his elbows resting
upon his knees and his face buried in his hands; restraint
had proven burdensome, though Ishida, his
old body-servant&#146;s counsel had strangely come to
wield over him an influence little short of Yodogima&#146;s
itself. Between the two, Yodogima&#146;s wish and Ishida&#146;s
advice, the taiko seemed at last utterly lost.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;You are kind, Hideyoshi, to respect my denial:
pray do not think me inconsiderate; I have news for
you; it is a son.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page169" id="page169"></a>[pg&nbsp;169]</span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>

<p class="indent">The taiko bounded up. That voice had filled
him as a chorus resounding tidings all but
heard in vain. No footstep had broken his reverie;
the sight of her seemed as impossible as the halo involving
his desire; the air he breathed had lost its
fragrance, the taste congealed, and the touch deadened,
but another sense had called him to life; Yodogima
confronted him.</p>
<p class="indent">There she stood, within reach, sublimer, if could be,
than before. Words had vainly made her message
better understood: not a moment would he lose, yet&mdash;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Oh, God, who am I to stand here like dumb? How
is it, these limbs fail me now, oh, so bitterly? What
devil stands between us? Or, is it lack of devil, and
Kami that denies? Answer me, you who can!&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">Hideyoshi fell to the floor whence he had risen.
The golden bowl was not broken, for the want of one.
Charm had not entered, hence could not depart. No
affinity proffered its good office. Love held forth elsewhere
in the mighty circle, and these two searched
their way under a solstice as blank as inevitable.</p>
<p class="indent">Yodogima, too, sank down, disappointed and fearful,
upon the mat in front of her lawful lord. The
child lay coddling in its lap, and her eyes beheld therein
a joy that radiates only as ordained. The picture overcame
him. He could not face the truth of her position,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page170" id="page170"></a>[pg&nbsp;170]</span>
and her eyes riveting upon the sacred book unfolding
before them denied him the only lie that man
ever made in virtuous part. All the laws of heaven
or man, cause and effect, could stay the hand nor
deaden the heart to that loftier reach, that unquenchable
thirst, that touchless affinity, which made man
what he is, as compared with the pitiful sight we
sometimes see, only to wish it an unreality, that hairy
monster, perched upon his hinder part, his arms drooping
in front and his face a blank, that living, suggestive,
appealing, undriveable thing we are always wont
but mostly loath to call baboon.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Oh!&#148; cried he, inwardly, &#147;am I so lost as to sit
here as if mad? This woman is stronger than I, in
the face of harsher trials. Be a man, Hideyoshi.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">Thence he arose, and approaching, vainly seated
himself directly in front of Yodogima. The child
cooed on, but two strong hearts waxed high over it,
with larger interest and harder conflict, as lions trample
their brood or the bird-kind but empty a nest in
its defense.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Pardon me, Yodogima,&#148; begged he, cowering
before her, his very soul the price, &#147;it is so sudden&mdash;let
me see your eyes, Yodogima&mdash;speak to me; I
cannot bear longer the suspense.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">Yodogima considerately raised her eyes to his: they
reflected back only the likeness of a man who had
never yet failed to penetrate deeper, but now the
heart seemed obscured by that self-same image.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;The child, Yodogima; let me look into its face.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page171" id="page171"></a>[pg&nbsp;171]</span>
Yodogima tenderly, perhaps proudly, tendered the
little babe, robed and attended as if want to invite
really the gods to worship at nativity&#146;s shrine. It
was a pretty boy, bearing traces in every feature of
its chivalrous ancestry: Hideyoshi had been proud,
would have prostituted every virtue that he possessed
to proffer it the crown he had wrought, but&mdash;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Ieyasu!&#148; conjured he, half in rage, half in fear.</p>
<p class="indent">Yodogima turned white, then livid; the child&#146;s doom
induced the former, but duty quickly inspired thoughts
restoring a healthier, heartier action of that one sense
underlying the most vital of nature&#146;s primal instincts.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Calm yourself, Yodogima; have no fear of man or
devil; Hideyoshi would burn down there before the
name or a hair of that child&#146;s mother should suffer
the discredit of a moment&#146;s reflection. More I cannot
say now: grant me time; it shall not be long; I
would go no farther than Azuchi.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">Bowing low, the taiko withdrew, and not stopping
longer than to call the norimonos (chair men) hurried
on, each stride burning deeper into his heart the dread
that gripped him more harshly than any death.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;What is it that makes you reticent?&#148; demanded he,
of Oyea, who trembled at his presence. &#147;I thought
your discretion, if not his tongue, of better promise.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Spare me, oh, spare me, honorable master; it is not
I, but the temple that betrayed you.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Ah&mdash;and he was there?&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;No.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Then you have been&mdash;&#148;</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page172" id="page172"></a>[pg&nbsp;172]</span>
&#147;No, no; yes, yes&mdash;&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;And know the truth, as I do now. Come, demean
yourself; I must return; tongues are no doubt already
wagging, whereas yours mutely convinces.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">The taiko returned thence faster than he had come.
A cloud had risen from his mind; there in the presence
of the one who had stood at his right through
all those tempestuous years the truth had at last
dawned: success attended insofar as others profited:
thirst might be inherited, but genius transmitted&mdash;never.</p>
<p class="indent">On the way it became necessary to pass directly
the new castle at Fushima, built for Hidetsugu, and
occupied as well, for the present, by Ieyasu as a
guest while returning from Nagoya to Yedo. Hideyoshi,
though anxious, could not resist the temptation
to stop&mdash;assigning as an excuse some urgency that
he and Ieyasu visit the mikado, since the opportunity
presented itself.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;But the child? its birth? why not proclaimed?&#148;
urged Ieyasu, cautiously.</p>
<p class="indent">Hideyoshi attempted no immediate answer, but Harunaga
did: pulling Ieyasu by the sleeve and suggesting
it a good time to make way with the taiko.</p>
<p class="indent">Now this perfectly feasible undertaking&mdash;Hideyoshi
was utterly unprepared and without sufficient
escort&mdash;somehow impressed itself directly upon him,
though he had neither seen the act performed nor
heard the words spoken by Harunaga; whom he had
recognized, no sooner than seen, only a few moments
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page173" id="page173"></a>[pg&nbsp;173]</span>
before, and upon inquiry found to be a transient guest
of Ieyasu&#146;s, traveling in train toward the castle
Ozaka.</p>
<p class="indent">Our taiko marvelled eagerly the circumstance, and
bided patiently some opportunity.</p>
<p class="indent">News of the birth had in fact reached the bonze&mdash;in
readiness&mdash;at Hiyeisan even before Hideyoshi
himself had been at all informed. Also the gossip
attending the taiko&#146;s failure of recognition: stranger
yet Oyea&#146;s enforced acknowledgment concerning the
temple and Yodogima were known to Harunaga in
time for him to discard his disguise as Katsutoya, a
bonze, and calling to his aid some two hundred horsemen,
held in hiding, make his way as far as Fushima
before the taiko had arrived.</p>
<p class="indent">Ieyasu hesitated; true he had not suspicioned Harunaga&#146;s
motive, nor suspected his knowledge of or
interest in Yodogima&#146;s affairs, not at all; but his interests
dictated, as he believed and Hideyoshi surmised,
an altogether less inhuman course.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;I am an old man,&#148; began Hideyoshi, addressing
Ieyasu, openly, and not without some pretty well remembered
impressions vividly made by none other
than Yodogima&#146;s long ago accurately aimed thrusts;
&#147;I find my sword heavy; please carry it for me.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">Ieyasu answered by saying:</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;I had a dream, last night: I dreamt that Tengu,
the hobgoblin, confronted me; and, of enormous proportions,
resolved himself into the size of an ant sitting
upon my arm: I swallowed him.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page174" id="page174"></a>[pg&nbsp;174]</span>
&#147;Good,&#148; replied Hideyoshi; &#147;I see the point; I am
rightly rebuked, for going about unattended.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Permit me to propose the good offices of Harunaga,
as an escort thence to Ozaka: I need not vouch
for him, a gentleman, and the taiko is&mdash;&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;A father,&#148; interposed Hideyoshi, looking Harunaga
squarely in the face.</p>
<p class="indent">The latter winced, but proffered his services, as
urged and designed by Ieyasu.</p>
<p class="indent">At Ozaka, notwithstanding Yodogima&#146;s assurances,
strange preparations were making for defence. No
word had escaped her lips as to the taiko&#146;s reception,
or purpose in leaving, or intentions about returning.
An ugly silence cast its spell over them, yet Hidetsugu,
the kwambaku, made his jealousy against the newborn
the more apparent by finally withdrawing to
reside permanently at Fushima, and Ishida not at all
thereby deceived, began forthwith the organizing of
a new force no less to protect the taiko than to enforce
the rights of Yodogima and her recently-born
claimant to his lordship&#146;s intended succession.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Did you think me long gone, Yodogima?&#148; inquired
Hideyoshi, approaching her, at ease, and alone, in the
great chamber, just off her own boudoir. &#147;I was delayed
no more against luck than strangely; Harunaga
is here, now, in the castle: in fact, came with me.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">His words were wasted, for Yodogima at once arose
to greet him, and never before did she seem quite
as graceful; her hair, loose and massive, hung in
wavelets far below her slender neck; the eyes fairly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page175" id="page175"></a>[pg&nbsp;175]</span>
burned as before, softened only with a compassion
new and compelling; a complexion yet bearing the
undercast of an ordeal intensifying the more its naturally
olive-like hue, that long flowing gown of silken
white which Hideyoshi had longed to see, and a voice
modulated with the sweetness of motherhood&mdash;the
taiko believed her in truth a goddess, thence prostrated
himself at the purport of her answer:</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;You alone are welcome, Hideyoshi.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;But the child, Yodogima?&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Shall I present it?&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Yes; it is mine; I name him Hideyori; let lanterns
be hung everywhere, proclaiming Hideyoshi&#146;s
successor; you are his rightful mother, and my sole
support; believe me, Yodogima; I swear it.&#148;</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page176" id="page176"></a>[pg&nbsp;176]</span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX</h2>

<p class="indent">With due promulgation, Hideyori&#146;s advent
occasioned upon the surface great rejoicing
everywhere throughout the land. Especially were the
tidings well received at Ozaka and thereabout: still
more earnestly by the older of Hideyoshi&#146;s immediate
supporters&mdash;those captains who had fought side by
side with him from obscurity to mastery; none among
them had so forgotten his duty as to think of independent
action or listen to a suggestion in contravention
of the taiko; he had been their guidance, and
upon his regeneration depended their welfare; the
father at once became a god, and the son his natural
prognosticator.</p>
<p class="indent">Quite different, however, with those forced or tolerated
into submission. Ieyasu had not tried out his
capabilities, and Ishida served only for a purpose.
Neither had sown that others might reap: each had
awaited the harvest as best suited his particular need
or environment; and now, at last, dissension foreboded
their several necessities. Both, therefore, sought without
delay to strengthen either one his own conjectured
position, in view of the taiko&#146;s possible retirement.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;You have no need to make oath, Hideyoshi,&#148; promised
Yodogima, in answer to his further protestations;
&#147;my interests and your purpose within themselves
make us but one. Command me.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page177" id="page177"></a>[pg&nbsp;177]</span>
&#147;Let some fitting entertainment be had; I have now
an heir, peace is at home, and China, I am told, sends
an envoy to crown me emperor; what greater joy
could be?&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">To this proposal Yodogima made no protest, in fact
encouraged its doing, yet knew full well the purport
and surmised an eagerness on the part of every
daimyo&mdash;invited or not&mdash;to seize any opportunity
to test underhandedly his influence or lay discreetly
some self-bettered plan. The taiko had whipped them
into subjection and she herself borne him a recognized
successor, but would the nation accept an authority
incapable of enforcing itself? Could individual
powers be transmitted in the absence of personal
prowess? In fact, were they a nation as yet?
If not, then what, required?</p>
<p class="indent">These were some of the questions vitally confronting
Yodogima at the very outset of her enlarged
career, and she had answered each satisfactorily to
herself: the husband&#146;s declining whimsicalities, presumably
more tolerable than impressive to others&mdash;in
view of their several intentions and universal unpreparedness&mdash;should
be made to promote not only
a devoted life&#146;s well earned vacation, but to attend as
well the immediate requirements of those upon whose
shoulders an unfinished work had certainly, if not
rightfully, fallen. The taiko&#146;s frivolities, therefore,
had been, likely, not only permitted but undertaken,
and the completion of the Fushima castle was made
the occasion: no captain would refuse, nor could any
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page178" id="page178"></a>[pg&nbsp;178]</span>
daimyo have been kept away except by force; the
first longed to do the master any honor, and the others
to avail themselves of what they designed making an
occasion for the feathering of their own nests, no
matter when or where the chance. Yodogima had not
been thought of, only as a mother, by any, excepting
possibly two&mdash;one a daimyo, the other a bakufu&mdash;had
not been contemplated as inevitably standing over
like the sun emerging behind a receding storm.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;You must attend, as I direct,&#148; urged Ieyasu, to
Esyo, who persisted in declining an invitation.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;I shall not,&#148; replied she, deigning to proffer no
excuse whatsoever.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Well,&#148; replied he, thoughtfully; &#147;this is a dilemma;
I cannot make you go consistently, but I shall resolve
at least a plausible stay at home&mdash;you can have Hidetada,
my son; perhaps a growing husband would suit
you better than a declining suitor. Take him and welcome.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Oh, I am not so particular; an infant might perchance
serve me as well as an older man served my
sister. Then, on the other hand, there is nothing like
agreeableness; Esyo is an obedient body, whatever else
you or others may contemplate. Let&#146;s have done with
it.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">They were married&mdash;she and the infant Hidetada&mdash;and
Esyo, in consequence, excused attendance upon
the taiko&#146;s grand cha-no-yu (tea-drinking party)&mdash;conserving
probably Ieyasu&#146;s pleasure or safety no
more than her own self-understood purpose.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page179" id="page179"></a>[pg&nbsp;179]</span>
Ishida, on the other hand, had brought all his persuasion
to bear upon Oyea&mdash;the taiko had quite
ignored or forgotten her, but Yodogima had not.
Many of the older captains retained at heart a warm
place for the elder wife, and truly sympathized with
her for her many sacrifices and half-requited support.
She had surrendered position and all that goes
with it to marry Hideyoshi in his poverty-stricken
beginning, and through all the trials and hardships of
a relentless struggle had never once lost faith or asked
a favor: Yodogima appreciated the influence her
presence should have upon this the most vital occasion
at which she had been privileged the prestige of
hostess.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;I regret very much Oyea&#146;s decision,&#148; said Yodogima,
to Ishida, shortly before the time set for the
entertainment. &#147;I wonder if some outside influence
can deter her? I hardly think so, however; Oyea is
above suspicion, and is the closest friend I have, aside
my own good sisters. Please pay her my best compliments,
and use your better judgment as to proper
measures; I can easily enough overlook Esyo&#146;s idiosyncracies,
but Oyea is a practical woman.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Your ladyship is quite right, and far-seeing if, perhaps,
most charitable, though not altogether inattentive.
There is an ulterior purpose, I will not say
reason&mdash;there could be no justice in any sort of
breach toward our good princess&mdash;believe me, your
ladyship&mdash;Ishida cannot speak otherwise, and my
long service as master of ceremonies to our most excellent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page180" id="page180"></a>[pg&nbsp;180]</span>
taiko, his lordship&mdash;beginning, as your honorable
ladyship well knows, these many years ago&mdash;as
I say, such a round, so highly prized and as graciously
bestowed, entitles one&mdash;I dare say, that your ladyship
herself would extend to an humbler subject a
consideration&mdash;arising only within the bosom of a
traditional appreciation little in evidence these days, I
tell you&mdash;emanating from a desire to do nothing contrary
to the best ethics of the times&mdash;dominating the
heart-interests especially of that one whom the master
has permitted us each and all alike to serve and revere
as jealously and considerately as the fleeting moments&mdash;&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Time is precious. Pardon me, Ishida?&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Yes; as I was about to say; Esyo out of the way,
Ieyasu is fast becoming a favorite at Azuchi; and,
though only a visitor at Fushima, may bode more than
a kwambaku&#146;s disseverance. These require drastic
consideration.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Hush. You speak unbecomingly.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Excuse me. I have only your ladyship&#146;s best interests
at heart.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;It were more like it, I trow, had you said &#145;in mind,&#146;
my good Ishida.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;No less at my finger&#146;s end, your ladyship.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Boaster&mdash;one might think you Sen-no-rikyu himself,
to hear you talk.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Stranger mistakes have been made.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Not to-day, Ishida.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Yodogima&mdash;&#148;</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page181" id="page181"></a>[pg&nbsp;181]</span>
&#147;Stop! You forget yourself; the taiko still lives:
it is he that we serve.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">The festal day coming on, and all in readiness, Sen-no-rikyu
apparently took his place at the bowl. No
man had greater fame than he. There had been
brewers of a superior flavor, but none ever reached
the excellence of Hideyoshi&#146;s day and favor, save Sen-no-rikyu,
and he alone. Famed as no man had been
at cha-no-yu, trusted as only a Hideyoshi knew how
to trust, truant or designer, patronized by an age
famed above all others in the wealth and luxury and
refinement and indulgence of a nobility unsurpassed
in the annals of time, this, the supposed Sen-no-rikyu,
but in fact substitute tea-server, a scion of all that had
gone before and a deceiver among adepts, may have
rightly thought himself, too, a master, undiscovered
and immune.</p>
<p class="indent">Had not these lords and ladies, serving and served,
the kuge and the bakufu, come or remained there to
partake of a hospitality made possible only by the perfection
of an art, a crafthood not comparable to the
deftness of his hand, with the cunning of his brain,
against the force of his will? What mattered if he
traduced as others reviled?</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;The hand that rules is not the one who feeds,&#148;
argued he, to himself, as the guests gathered in anticipation
of all that Hideyoshi, the greatest of them, had
thought to develop in life or fought to leave at death.</p>
<p class="indent">And they did patronize thus in gorgeous splendor.
Silks soft to the touch and pleasing to behold covered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page182" id="page182"></a>[pg&nbsp;182]</span>
these people, whose bodies bore no taint of coarse,
close-fitting and ill-shaped garments. The great
chamber in which they lounged comfortably or demeaned
themselves gracefully bespoke cycles of rigid
aesthetics; the crude walls and hard-made floors, cumbersome
furniture and meaningless ornaments of
earlier days had long ago succumbed to oblivion&#146;s
kindlier grace. The food they ate, and the tea they
drank&mdash;only a god could brew and serve it as they
wot.</p>
<p class="indent">Seated there as placed, no sense of man disturbed
them&mdash;the animal had been subdued in times gone
by&mdash;thought, too, lost all sway, and only the soul
called down from ethereal realms a glory that made
earth in truth a heaven.</p>
<p class="indent">A careful hand filled the fated cup. Nature-clad
messengers bore it toward the taiko. The cha-no-yu
had begun.</p>
<p class="indent">Two simply-robed humans, no different except in
degree, sat at the head of this vast compulsorily
punctilious assemblage&mdash;the one at the other&#146;s side.
The messengers came on, and no sound issued or lip
as much as moved. Hideyoshi raised his hand to take
the coveted draught, but Yodogima, instead, seized the
cup and, raising it to her lips, a mighty confusion
broke forth, from Ishida to her husband, over that
beaten and mystified audience&mdash;Sen-no-rikyu was nowhere
there; Ishida sat in his place!</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;What? Would you, even you, deny me first&mdash;Yodogima?&#148;
tremblingly asked the taiko.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page183" id="page183"></a>[pg&nbsp;183]</span>
&#147;It is Hidetsugu&#146;s fault,&#148; shouted Ishida, undisguising
in the confusion and rushing forward. &#147;He
has poisoned the princess&mdash;please strike him and
pardon her,&#148; continued he, snatching the cup away
and dashing its contents upon the floor.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;No,&#148; replied Yodogima, composedly; &#147;Ishida
speaks falsely; it is mine to answer.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">Outside the rattle and purpose of troops made itself
quickly apparent, and Ieyasu sprang up, commanding:</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;My sword.&#148; Then, &#147;Forward, guards!&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">The taiko only railed the harder; he could not look
or feel beyond the insult sustained; Yodogima had
committed an act no penalty other than direst torture
could atone.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;I have not seen Hidetsugu, know not his purpose,
or any other man&#146;s, but I also have a duty to perform:
if in that I have transgressed, then let me suffer
therefor. What is one life as compared with so
many?&#148; continued Yodogima, without any intimation
as to what she herself, Ishida, and the Sen-no-rikyu
alone knew.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Hideyoshi has been insulted and the guilty must
suffer. How are the captains? Where Ieyasu?&#148;
demanded the taiko, nervously.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Time will tell,&#148; suggested Ishida. &#147;In the meantime
your humble servant would advise that Hideyori
be taken in charge&mdash;I myself, with your lordship&#146;s
permission, shall attend Yodogima.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Let Oyea stand sponsor for Hideyori; Yodogima
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page184" id="page184"></a>[pg&nbsp;184]</span>
has proven herself untrustworthy&mdash;do with her as
you like; I shall have enough to attend Hidetsugu.
Produce the child,&#148; commanded the taiko, believing
himself abused beyond forgiveness.</p>
<p class="indent">Yodogima sank down bewildered. Jokoin had been
an onlooker and believed her sister in the right, though
she knew nothing and could not account for the circumstance.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Never mind, sister; Jokoin shall console you,&#148;
promised she, coming forward in a manner strictly her
own, however menacingly it may have seemed.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;And you, Hideyoshi, are just as mean as you can
be. Now, then,&#148; continued Jokoin, stamping her foot
in the taiko&#146;s presence.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Hei, yeo! Ishida, we shall have enough of it,
before done; I know this little elf, of old,&#148; threatened
Hideyoshi, vainly trying to hide a deeper, more laborious
concern.</p>
<p class="indent">The world, however, seemed awhirl, and Yodogima
had surrendered, but Harunaga watched his chance:</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Do not despair, Yodogima; the child shall not be
torn from its mother,&#148; whispered he, and his words
roused within her a new life.</p>
<p class="indent">Hidetsugu came in&mdash;he had flown at Ishida&#146;s accusation&mdash;in
the charge of Ieyasu, who had surrounded
and taken him at his own quarters, while in the act of
communicating with Mori, a friend to Ishida. It had
been the kwambaku&#146;s guards marching, contrary to
his orders or knowledge, but well within the plans and
connivance of Ishida, that caused the disturbance,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page185" id="page185"></a>[pg&nbsp;185]</span>
prompting Ieyasu to adopt extreme measures&mdash;cutting
down and dispersing them without inquiry or
cause.</p>
<p class="indent">Ishida laughed. He stood at Hideyoshi&#146;s right.
Yodogima in the melee had disappeared, in company
with Jokoin, as induced by Harunaga.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;I am guilty of no wrongdoing: God is my judge,&#148;
protested Hidetsugu, confronting Hideyoshi.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Why, then, have you sought to impose a new form
of oath?&#148; inquired the taiko, calling Mori to witness.</p>
<p class="indent">Hidetsugu stumbled&mdash;there were several Christians
present and he himself had more than once favored
the good father Grecchi, though none now offered him
as much as a consolation.</p>
<p class="indent">Hideyoshi marvelled the circumstance.</p>
<p class="indent">It now came Ieyasu&#146;s turn, and he answered by
absenting himself; it occurring that there might be
some further advantage gotten of China; Chin Ikei
had not yet crowned Hideyoshi.</p>
<p class="indent">With reaching her own apartment, Yodogima&#146;s
spirit rekindled; but&mdash;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;The child!&#148; shrieked she, as it dawned that Hideyori
was nowhere to be found.</p>
<p class="indent">The moments seemed ages now, and a thousand
occasions suggested the most likely place to search&mdash;yet
back of it all there stood the look of Ishida. He had
proffered Hideyoshi the cup, condemned Hidetsugu,
and baffled Ieyasu: had he likewise the need of kidnapping
her child? Were he in truth master of Hideyoshi?
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page186" id="page186"></a>[pg&nbsp;186]</span>
Could she not play him and Ieyasu yet, one
against the other, to some advantage?&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Have faith, Yodogima; we still have Taketomo,
my own dear little imp, and our intended ruse may
yet avail&mdash;in the opposite direction. Would you believe
it, Harunaga says Take looks enough like Hide
to be his brother; and I&#146;m sure you can have him, and
welcome, for I should just love to find another like
him.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">Yodogima snatched the child up, and vowed that
the rearing of children and the conserving of fortune
were two occupations utterly incompatible and hopelessly
attempted&mdash;Hideyoshi had, without further
consultation or compunction, sent Hidetsugu, his three
children, their mothers and some thirty other ladies
of his court to the execution grounds at Kyoto.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;These are marvels, not virtues: therein lies my
strength,&#148; surmised the expectant princess, long before
&#147;The Mound of Beasts&#148; had echoed its final warning
over against the headsmen&#146;s block in Sanjomachi.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page187" id="page187"></a>[pg&nbsp;187]</span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI</h2>

<p class="indent">A consummation covertly auguring the final
purpose of Ishida; who had so ingratiated
himself into the grace of their master that an intrigue
against him had been in fact resolved into a better
consequence. With Hidetsugu out of the way, only
Hideyori stood between him and final authority&mdash;so
thought Ishida: another occasion might prove more
certainly Hideyoshi&#146;s fate.</p>
<p class="indent">The doors at Fushima stood ajar, and Hideyoshi
entered: there seemed no friend now other than
Ishida; who, also, deemed it convenient or necessary
to dwell elsewhere, mostly; and only sycophants and
confusion surrounded the taiko.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;O Hideyoshi,&#148; pleaded he, self-conscious and overdone.
&#147;Has it come to this? Is there none left me?&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">Only the cold dread of conjured ingratitude answered.
Hell itself had been a relief in those drawn
moments of flickering consciousness, and the taiko
grappled the more uncertainly at every fleeting fancy
that danced on in one endless concourse, faithless,
hopeless, and uncharitable, then withering, again torturing,
as if undecided or bent upon nothing more.</p>
<p class="indent">Ishida now held fast mostly at Ozaka: the child absorbed
Yodogima&#146;s attention, and Ieyasu found it no
less agreeable to sojourn in the vicinity of Azuchi:
here, too, the child engaged partly the elder wife,
Oyea.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page188" id="page188"></a>[pg&nbsp;188]</span>
&#147;Now mind you,&#148; enjoined Ishida, upon Oyea, at a
secret conference, outside the walls at Azuchi, atop
the hill in Hiyeisan; &#147;let there be no mishap; present
the child only upon my signal; then Oyea shall be
first in favor and Ishida her lifelong slave.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;You can trust me, Ishida; do your part as well;
the captains shall not ignore me, as Hideyoshi once
did, though their recent conduct would incline one
to the belief that they were capable of it.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">Jokoin had directly realized in Harunaga a gallant
superber than warmth, even hers, could have desired:
more fervid, perhaps, than Kyogoku, her husband, approved:
not as discreet as some of Hideyoshi&#146;s followers
would have.</p>
<p class="indent">In consequence, Ieyasu had found it possible to
urge upon Yodogima measures that he little knew
circumstances had made it possible for her to understand
and seize upon&mdash;in their true light. She had
promised, therefore&mdash;as Oyea had sooner agreed
with Ishida&mdash;to be at hand and await, likewise, her
would-be deceiver&#146;s proposals.</p>
<p class="indent">The two, Ieyasu and Ishida, the one planning and
the other carrying out, had arranged with Chin Ikei
the taiko&#146;s coronation. The coveted crown should,
with concluding pomp, be placed securely there. Hideyoshi
was to be made, apparently, emperor of all the
Orient. Ieyasu schemed and Ishida advised: Hideyoshi
succumbed, to their cajolery, an easy prey; he
had subdued Japan, overrun Korea, and outwitted
China, he thought; what were other men&#146;s contentions
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page189" id="page189"></a>[pg&nbsp;189]</span>
or reliances as compared with the feel and the
fetch of glory?</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Let everybody witness Hideyoshi&#146;s just finale,&#148;
commanded he; if not altogether impotently, then,
perhaps, a bit sarcastically.</p>
<p class="indent">No man or woman, however, willingly missed the
occasion; they crowded round from everywhere.
Hideyoshi, arrayed in robes of purple, sat high upon
pillows of curled feathers with hand-embroidered
cases. His own three hundred serving maids lounged
round the room or grouped in corners awaiting their
master&#146;s every whim. On the outside bands of music
horned or stringed notes soothing, but no longer stirring.
Not a guard or soldier marred the serenity of
Hideyoshi&#146;s belief, and only the covenant bearers disturbed
the silence ensuing a taiko&#146;s exultation.</p>
<p class="indent">The crown rested, impatiently, upon its golden-lacquered
tray in front.</p>
<p class="indent">An ambassador advanced.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Our commission,&#148; declared he, bowing low.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Read it,&#148; commanded Hideyoshi.</p>
<p class="indent">The interpreter complied:</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;We do invest you King of Japan&mdash;&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;What? Crown me of less than I possess? No!&#148;
shouted he, snatching up the document, casting off
that robe, and throwing down the crown.</p>
<p class="indent">The rage of Hideyoshi only increased with each
attempted explanation; the real perpetrators stood
mute in the background, the one bent upon Hideyori&#146;s
destruction, the other confident of a mother&#146;s triumph.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page190" id="page190"></a>[pg&nbsp;190]</span>
The acknowledged son and, now, only possible successor
destroyed, Ishida believed it easy to lay his
hand securely upon the reins of government: trusting
his judgment, the taiko could be wrought into no more
favorable mood than the one at present so forcibly
expressed. Ieyasu, on the other hand, faltered; he
adjudged Yodogima capable, but Hideyoshi fighting
mad and in a corner had only too often proven it the
death knell to any one, hated or loved, who had as
yet invoked the temerity to confront him.</p>
<p class="indent">The plan in truth of his own making, and its working
in perfect accord to this the culminating point,
convinced him the more that someone had found him
out and now fared ready to reap the reward of his
iniquity.</p>
<p class="indent">Ieyasu stood paralyzed&mdash;yet no one seemed to
suffer a moment&#146;s loss or to heed at all any sort of
plight in consequence of his failure. Ieyasu, as if
dumb, Ishida exulted the more: Oyea came forth as
understood, and bowing down laid the child at Hideyoshi&#146;s
feet&mdash;the taiko gasped; speech had failed.</p>
<p class="indent">Oyea, also, had insulted him; dared to flaunt in his
face what he knew that she knew was not his: the
taiko was angered.</p>
<p class="indent">Ieyasu withdrew, as quietly as he had remained,
and no one would have been the wiser had not Yodogima&mdash;hidden
away so disguised that even he had
failed her&mdash;observed his every movement: when he
had gone, then Harunaga shadowed his further progress
and&mdash;</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page191" id="page191"></a>[pg&nbsp;191]</span>
Doffing the veil, Yodogima quickly, yet softly, and
considerately, approached, unwrapping and laying
before his highness another child, not unlike the first
in face and form.</p>
<p class="indent">Hideyoshi looked up, a changed man; in a mother&#146;s
presence there had dawned a new understanding.</p>
<p class="indent">Ishida rushed forward, and Oyea drew back: a
common wrangle ensued, and no one appeared to
know just what to say or think or do. Some contended
that one or the other of the two children belonged
to Oyea, for had she not brought it there, and
proffered hers for recognition? But which one? Why
her silence? Others claimed that only a mother could
know her child; whereat the taiko frowned and Ishida
smiled.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Which one, Ishida; this is an important business,
and there should be no mistake?&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">Yodogima had claimed them both, now, in the absence
of Oyea, who stood back, trembling and cogitating.
No thought disturbed the mother, whose only
care centered in the child; to deprive her of hers, she
alone must make the selection: Hideyoshi had never
knowingly committed an avoidable wrong.</p>
<p class="indent">Ishida blushed; the truth had at last dawned also
upon him, and turning to Yodogima the closely cornered
man mumbled:</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Which is he, Yodogima?&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Let the guilty determine, as I have done,&#148; replied
she, interested and secure.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page192" id="page192"></a>[pg&nbsp;192]</span>
&#147;Both of them, your highness,&#148; stammered Ishida,
facing Hideyoshi.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Then it was, as well, Ishida who poisoned, not
Yodogima, but the intended cup? Away with you, and
let one who has no need to choose pronounce judgment,
for her son is my heir, and henceforth your
kwambaku&mdash;I command it,&#148; vowed Hideyoshi, with
no other consolation or assurance than a mother&#146;s
kindly feeling, to foster and encourage the last act or
wish of an utterly unrealized, if totally expended,
higher ambition.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page193" id="page193"></a>[pg&nbsp;193]</span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII</h2>

<p class="indent">With the passing of Hideyoshi, Yodogima faced
a maze possibly less promising than had
the taiko lived longer&mdash;to suffer violence or subversion
at the hands of those eager and prepared to
take advantage of his decline. The captains, his real
adherents, stood as it were, confused and unready;
whereas had any one of the enemy&#146;s schemes to do
the master false sooner proven successful there should
no doubt have been in consequence a mere pronounced
or sudden welding and rousing of them to the cause
he left. Yet, in the face of uncertainty, they gathered
to a man in support of the infant kwambaku: also
many of the larger daimyos proffered their friendship&mdash;if
not to Hideyori, then to his mother&mdash;and
Ozaka rang again resonant with the glamor of
authority.</p>
<p class="indent">Oyea had been ignored, perhaps understood; Hideyoshi,
at the last moment taking from her every visage
of authority&mdash;discerning Yodogima&#146;s true disposition&mdash;her
own conduct in the presence of all and
under stress of a last appeal alienated others upon
whom she might have reasonably depended.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;I&#146;ll yet see her burned at the stake,&#148; muttered
Oyea, departing unheeded and alone toward the
beggarly inheritance left her&mdash;Azuchi, and that as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page194" id="page194"></a>[pg&nbsp;194]</span>
well with no other immediate chance or real adviser
save Esyo, the wife of an infant, a son of Ieyasu,
Hidetada, verily Buddhist born.</p>
<p class="indent">A mixed situation, therefore, presented itself for
her delectation. Yodogima had won favors on every
hand, and there were no more Christians than
Buddhists at Ozaka, with Shintoists a plenty and to
spare over both. The government had been, as a
last resort, intrusted to the care of five designated
Regents during the minority of Hideyori: the taiko
believed Yodogima competent to see that justice were
done, and no one there assumed his responsibility
more readily or inauspiciously than she.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;I&#146;ll make my son ruler in fact, not alone suffer
him to succeed in name: what greater end can a
mother achieve than succor the laurels of a child she
bears?&#148; meditated she, as the luxuries&mdash;even shorn
of the comforts&mdash;of a respected, though unloved,
husband&#146;s bounty showered down upon and around
her.</p>
<p class="indent">Kuroda accepting command, not a captain among
them&mdash;excepting Takiyama&mdash;wavered in his loyalty
or bore the slightest mistrust. The chests were filled
to bursting; no such bounty as that left in Ozaka had
theretofore accumulated, and new recruits proffered
enlistment from every source save one&mdash;Yedo apparently
foresaw another need for its soldiery.</p>
<p class="indent">The regents had sworn to respect the will of their
deceased taiko, who had enjoined them severally and
collectively from engaging in political marriages of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page195" id="page195"></a>[pg&nbsp;195]</span>
whatsoever kind or character during the regency: as
Ieyasu and Ishida both stood highest in council,
Yodogima very naturally had good occasion to rest
easy thereabout on her own account, and certainly
nowise other respecting Hideyori, her son and their
kwambaku.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;There is nothing to this <i>San Filipe</i> affair; it was
but the babbling of an underling, who, finding himself
in a tight place, sought by braggadocio to escape
further custody or avoid some fancied harm; please
do not refer to it again,&#148; begged Yodogima, of Ishida,
who had called professedly to advise her of certain
rumors, which she had sooner heard, emanating no
one seemed to know just how or where, yet surmised
high in authority.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;But Ieyasu is bent upon expelling the Christians,
and of course needs some excuse. No doubt your
ladyship is right in her estimation, still there are other
reasons why the good and faithful should listen to
any proposal aiming at perhaps total extinction, and
Ieyasu is clever.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Are you not his equal? And, I am sure, there can
be no good reason for drastic measures except it be
political. Are a few priests, a dozen or so daimyos,
and a handful of followers to be treated a menace?
Nonsense! None knew better than Hideyoshi the
province and probabilities of religion, and I mean to
be as tolerant, if not so capable. Must you let every
project that comes along, invented or otherwise,
swerve you in your bounden duty? Christianity has
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page196" id="page196"></a>[pg&nbsp;196]</span>
quite as much right or reason to thrive and comfort
whoso or whereat as any other religion: when creed
has proven itself fruitless, it shall die of its own
accord: as soon as inimical to further progress, then
chop it down; man is neither rank nor incapable.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">The sun shone hot out of a clear sky, and the
shade fell invitingly from an aged wistaria that hung
in profusion overhead. Threatening clouds gathered
and banked huge and dark in the west, yet the voice
of storm had not sounded there, in Ozaka, where they
two sat, overlooking the glassy bay to the southward,
nor had it quite closed with Amaterasu in her downward
whirl toward the passing of day. They pondered,
and a sail came into view far distant.</p>
<p class="indent">There appeared nothing as yet to distinguished
it from one of their own, and the imagination played
on. Who has not been stirred by the mysteries of an
undiscernable ship at sea?</p>
<p class="indent">Once upon a time the good <i>San Filipe</i> had likewise
stolen in upon them; a storm drove her against shoals;
as was custom and law they seized her and confiscated
the cargo; the pilot captured and questioned, confidently,
but proudly, spread before them a chart showing
the vast domain of Spain, his native country, and
the ship&#146;s defender.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;How came your king by all these possessions?&#148;
Hideyoshi had asked him.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Oh, that is simple enough,&#148; replied the unsophisticated
sailor. &#147;We first send out our religieux to convert
the people, then seize upon their lands with an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page197" id="page197"></a>[pg&nbsp;197]</span>
army supported by the newly made Christians. It&#146;s
easily done.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;What? My states filled with traitors, and the
government about to devolve upon a child? Impossible!&#148;
cried the taiko, amid his adherents, and the
echo had not died or ceased of its meaning.</p>
<p class="indent">This unguarded statement of the over-anxious, yet
innocent Spaniard, of the merchant class&mdash;and not
so particular about the fate of priests or religion&mdash;that,
it were, had, more than anything else, among
other things, convinced Ieyasu of Hideyoshi&#146;s having
acted very unwisely, through weakness or decline,
with yielding to the importunities or blandishments of
a woman, Yodogima or Jokoin, presumably the
former, in permitting the priests to return to Nagasaki;
that it now became him as a leader, first of all
to remove them bag and baggage from the land.
They had seized upon their reinstatement with an
avidity that augured renewed activity and their operations
seemed directed chiefly toward Ozaka, alternating
between the highest and the lowest in or out of
authority.</p>
<p class="indent">A prodigious evil this appeared to be&mdash;the gathering
and fraternizing of the high and the lowly, the
good and the ill, the interested and the disinterested,
under the auspices of a single flag, unfurled and waved
solely and authoritatively by none other than Ishida,
whom he knew and could not misunderstand.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;You accuse Yodogima wrongly,&#148; said he, to Oyea,
as they too sat upon a veranda, overlooking not the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page198" id="page198"></a>[pg&nbsp;198]</span>
sea, but that selfsame lake, Biwa, with its more subtle,
if less inspiring outlook. &#147;She is surrounded with
evil influences, and must be relieved. Her motives
are pure&mdash;over-intended&mdash;but the chicanery of
Ishida is more than a woman should be left to cope.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Then it is Yodogima that concerns our lord:
the Christians are but an excuse?&#148; queried Oyea,
with suppressed emotion.</p>
<p class="indent">Ieyasu answered discreetly with a question; still
resist as best he could, the rising color in his face
disclosed to Oyea unmistakably the one truth which
had under-disturbed her every thought and action
since the day she had consoled with Yodogima in
the hope that Ieyasu should not lose to Hideyoshi:</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Why do you ask, Oyea?&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Is it not enough that I have insured you Hideki,
my nephew&#146;s support, intrigued with Ishida to further
your cause, surrendered favors, which I might have
had, in the interests of one whom I&mdash;&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Hold, Oyea. You have already gone too far. I
am loved, and I love&mdash;&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;But Oyea is patient: I am not too old&mdash;will
serve you&mdash;look, Ieyasu; my face comely&mdash;form
preserved&mdash;&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">Ieyasu turned away, toward the mountains: looked
into space, limitless and conjectural. Words had been
worse than a crime, then. Oyea read the answer,
searched his innermost depths; she had failed the taiko;
should Ieyasu take her on trust? True her hair was
streaked, but underneath that, down deep in her heart,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page199" id="page199"></a>[pg&nbsp;199]</span>
there held and beat a warmth as fervid, an ardor as
prone, and the purpose as strong as of the days when
Hideyoshi had abused a confidence no less compellingly
bestowed.</p>
<p class="indent">Thunder rumblings in the distance, lightning flashes
bolting the heavens, ominous clouds overcasting the
earth&mdash;these drove home the dragon&#146;s fearful promise:
Oyea only drew closer round her the simple
kimono she so gratefully wore.</p>
<p class="indent">Arising, Ishida approached, and respreading his
rug sat nearer. Yodogima gazed the more intently at
the tiny speck upon the angering waters in front.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;How like a human,&#148; mused she, as the struggling
bark raised and lowered, bantered or plowed its way
toward the beacon that fond anticipation shall never
cease of hailing.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;It lacks originality,&#148; ventured he, in some vainly
attempted response.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;As I do, you may think,&#148; retorted the princess,
bowing with just a blush, which no man could resist.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;You grant me undeserved merit, your ladyship.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Why not &#145;Yodogima&#146;, though not guilty of as
much as a thought?&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;May I dare?&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;I should be mean to deny a worthy man,&#148;
responded she, with a look more convincing than
words could have been.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;I&#146;ll prove it, my lady. In the meantime&mdash;oh,
Ishida; what an ass to bandy opportunity!&#148; muttered
he, bounding off, as convinced as pleased.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page200" id="page200"></a>[pg&nbsp;200]</span>
With a long drawn sigh, perhaps of satisfaction,
Yodogima continued gazing into the distance. The
approaching vessel had ceased to be a center of
attraction, though still tossing and laboring with the
elements. Subtler affairs now engrossed all the princess&#146;s
attention, and clapping carelessly for a servant
Junkei approached unreservedly:</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Call Maeda,&#148; commanded she, dreamily.</p>
<p class="indent">Junkei bowing low departed on the run; long service
with Hideyoshi had wrought of him a veritable
machine, self-wound, but motionless till sprung. Not
far to go, Maeda soon appeared and the princess
greeted him with reverence; for he it was who had
accommodated her father with a horse and service on
his last flight from the enemy. Yodogima loved the
old veteran, who by dint of prudence and much quivering
had preserved his life and retained a domain
through all those troublesome years of Hideyoshi&#146;s
enforced subduction.</p>
<p class="indent">None save Ieyasu&mdash;of those near the capital,
and only two others, widely separated, at the two
extremes of the empire&mdash;could boast or master a
larger income or force: not a daimyo of them all bore
the respect generally that this giant of a bygone day
enjoyed among them. Hence Hideyoshi, himself,
before death, had singled him out as the best fitted or
suited to exercise public guardianship over the infant
Kwambaku, Hideyori, during his minority, a thankless
undertaking at best, refused by Ieyasu&mdash;perhaps
at the request of Yodogima, for she trusted in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page201" id="page201"></a>[pg&nbsp;201]</span>
Maeda&#146;s honesty: believed herself competent and
rightly entitled, if not best intended, to direct.</p>
<p class="indent">Maeda, therefore, was legal guardian, and no two
held forth in stricter confidence than he and Yodogima.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Sit down, Maeda,&#148; commanded she&mdash;he, too,
bore toward her the respect due a superior.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;I beg to be at your service, my lady,&#148; responded
he, seating himself near at hand.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;You are a friend to Ieyasu, Maeda?&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Yes, my lady,&#148; unconcernedly.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;You are a friend to Ishida?&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Yes, my lady,&#148; with growing interest.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Then I would warn you: beware of Ishida.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">The old man trembled perceptibly; to question the
integrity of a friend was more than he could do, and
to listen to a proposal like that had fairly unnerved
him&mdash;yet he knew this daughter of an older champion,
had studied her every mood from childhood up:
no uncertain thing could prompt her to make such
a declaration.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;I thank you, Yodogima&mdash;pardon the allusion; I
was thinking of your father,&#148; replied he, presently the
moments passed.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Thank you, my lord,&#148; responded she, no less
spontaneously.</p>
<p class="indent">A greater respect could not have been paid him,
or an honor more highly appreciated; the old diplomat
thenceforth knew no higher duty, cherished not
a thought other than to uphold the child whose mother
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page202" id="page202"></a>[pg&nbsp;202]</span>
he believed divinely cast, no matter what his opinion
or other men&#146;s contentions might be&mdash;about a father.</p>
<p class="indent">Maeda had pledged himself irredeemably, and
Yodogima believed the fortress impregnable against
the arms alike their cunning of any man or combination
that might dare or choose to go against it.
Night came on, and they parted; the ship she had
fancied vanished, with the light that lowered real.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>

<p class="indent">Ishida and Masuda lingered longer than usual
at the cups, on a dark night soon after, while
their conversation, heated and close, kept rhythm to
the customary &#147;whack, whack,&#148; their metal pipes
ringing and the hours lessening.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Then it is true that Jokoin really bore a son, this
Hachisuka, to whom Ieyasu has just now married his
granddaughter, Ogasa,&#148; queried Masuda. &#147;I wonder
how long it will be till he, himself, has taken Yodogima
for wife? He seems to have ignored the taiko&#146;s
enjoinder, altogether: perhaps he may have convenient
some other granddaughter or such like for
Hideyori: what chance shall there be for the rest of
us then? I really believe he aims at succeeding Hideyoshi
in authority.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">Ishida shifted uneasy.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;They say he was, once, in love with the princess.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Love! He&#146;s too cold for that: I should sooner
think him in quest of the treasure stored away there,
at Ozaka, in Maeda&#146;s keep.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Do you know,&#148; continued Ishida, without further
reference to Yodogima, &#147;that two of them, Ieyasu
and Maeda, united, are competent and capable of
doing about as they like? They must be antagonized,
and you and I shall do it; ally yourself with the
former, and I will attend the latter.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page204" id="page204"></a>[pg&nbsp;204]</span>
&#147;But Yodogima is friendly to both of them, in
some measure.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;So much the better, for Oyea is as hot against
her, and if we fail at the one, why, then we have a
surer remedy.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">Thus they separated, and Ishida calling at the
castle convinced Maeda that it were high time for
Ieyasu to pay his respects to Hideyori, their rising
superior. Maeda, the guardian, without any suspicion
as to motive or consultation with Yodogima,
issued the invitation, and Masuda as soon advised
Ieyasu that Maeda plotted to kill him.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Maeda harm me? There must be some mistake,&#148;
replied Ieyasu, a bit puzzled, but not the least
shaken.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;There can be none, however, about this letter,&#148;
suggested Masuda, producing one, in the hand of its
supposed writer. &#147;Perhaps my lord is familiar with
the handwriting. It was intercepted between Yodogima,
the mother, and his grace, the good guardian&mdash;can
your lordship unravel the meaning, to some better
purpose?&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">Ieyasu turned pale. Though understanding well
enough its purport, somehow the chirography did not
exactly satisfy him, and wheeFling round toward Esyo&mdash;who
of late had made it her business to sojourn
mostly between Fushima, Ieyasu&#146;s recently adopted
domicile, and Azuchi, Oyea&#146;s deserted or despised
hearth&mdash;Ieyasu&mdash;grandfather to Kita, Esyo&#146;s first
born, a daughter&mdash;significantly asked:</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page205" id="page205"></a>[pg&nbsp;205]</span>
&#147;Who wrote it, Esyo?&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">Esyo stammered; for once she had been taken
unawares:</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Perhaps Jokoin might know. Shall I call her; she
is close by, engaged just now with Takiyama; you
know he is quite friendly&mdash;&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;No; I would rather not put her to the test, as
I did you, my daughter. But where is her husband,
Kyogoku?&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Oh, he&#146;s at Ozaka; preferred Kitagira and the
shrine to his wife and a church; though Maeda,
really, distrusts them both; poor, lonely soul; he&#146;s
about the only Christian left there; a pleasing enough
circumstance to Yodogima, I presume, now that she&#146;s
a favorite among the captains and the bearer of a&mdash;&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Cannot you control your tongue? Now Kita, your
own daughter, shall marry Hideyori, as I command.
Go hence.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Where to, Azuchi?&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;If you like; I can do quite well without either of
you.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Perhaps.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">Ieyasu did not make the visit, however, and Yodogima,
advised of the circumstance, consulted Hosokawa,
Maeda&#146;s most ardent friend; whose wife, Grace
of Tango, a staunch Christian, not only bore intimate
terms with Jokoin, keeping strict account of her
entangling alliances, but actively inspired some
acquaintance with all things pertaining accidentally or
discreetly to the new religion.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page206" id="page206"></a>[pg&nbsp;206]</span>
&#147;Let Ishida separate Maeda and Ieyasu, if he will,
but see to it no harm is done either one; we cannot
so much control men&#146;s acts as adapt ourselves inadvertently
to results,&#148; urged Yodogima, no less concerned
about Ieyasu&#146;s than Ishida&#146;s motive.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;How do you know that it is Ishida, who seeks their
disalliance?&#148; queried Hosokawa, unadvised, yet suspicious.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Intuitively, I presume,&#148; replied she, unconcernedly,
but not without arousing deeper thought on his part.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;What would your ladyship have me do, then, if
there is danger ahead for either or both of them; they
must be gotten together in some way?&#148; replied he,
hopelessly at sea.</p>
<p class="indent">Yodogima shrugged her shoulders; a first glimpse
at intrigue seemed ready to burst into fruitage more
bitter than she could unmovedly contemplate.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Whatever else you may advise, do not countenance,
for a moment, Maeda&#146;s leaving the castle. Let Ieyasu
come here; it is proper that he should, and if he
refuse, then beware: there are two reasons why Hideyori&#146;s
guardian should not expose himself.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">Hosokawa minded the advice, but Maeda did not;
going directly to visit his friend Ieyasu, who had
sooner left Azuchi, to resume uninterruptedly his
residence at Fushima.</p>
<p class="indent">Yodogima remained up all that night, devising
how best to keep her skirts clear of an impending
crisis. She had discovered Ishida, and penetrated
Ieyasu. True she had favored the Christians, but not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page207" id="page207"></a>[pg&nbsp;207]</span>
out of sympathy for them or their creed; she believed
them no less abused than abusive, and among the
flower of the nobility entitled to such protection and
encouragement as her influence and position might
render&mdash;the possibilities of their united support had
not as yet dawned, neither the occasion; Ieyasu alone
had discerned and forestalled, planning the division of
a house unto itself.</p>
<p class="indent">Through the marriage of his granddaughter to the
son of Jokoin&mdash;innocent as she was&mdash;he had enlisted
into his services the sympathy or support of the
younger and most active in the new school; Takiyama,
Gamo, and others of the hot bloods had followed
in the trail of their bewitching Jokoin, while
Kuroda, still piqued and guerilla-like, continued with
the mending of his own fortunes far away at Kyushu.</p>
<p class="indent">Yet, in the face of these discouragements, Jokoin
came in upon the deeper thinking Yodogima.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Take my advice, sister,&#148; said she, confidingly, &#147;and
submit to Ieyasu&#146;s rule. He is able and willing
and Hideyori is only a child, and don&#146;t you whisper it,
I believe he is madly in love with you still. Come, let&#146;s
have peace; and after all I don&#146;t believe Ishida is a
whit better Christian than Ieyasu; there isn&#146;t one of
them, not a daimyo, converted or designing or otherwise,
who would let go a single wife for the whole
Christian paraphernalia&mdash;and I&#146;m not so sure but
they are right, after all. Let Hideyori acknowledge
Ieyasu&mdash;Oyea advises it, and as sure as fate she is
wise.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page208" id="page208"></a>[pg&nbsp;208]</span>
Without attempting any answer to her harangue,
Yodogima bade the sister welcome, inquiring discreetly
as to the good fortune and better intentions of
Oyea.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Oh, she is gaining somewhat in favor since Ieyasu
is known to have taken her up; but, I am afraid
Esyo shall spoil it all; nobody likes her; and, do you
know, she displayed the affrontery to drive her father-in-law,
the great Ieyasu, from Azuchi&mdash;I left her
there, in the company of Ishida.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">Just then a servant came in, informing Yodogima
that Maeda lay dying at his quarters, elsewhere within
the castle enclosure.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page209" id="page209"></a>[pg&nbsp;209]</span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>

<p class="indent">Momentarily, at the mention of Ieyasu&#146;s
love, Yodogima brightened; something moved
her to a kindlier remembrance of the man who had so
often defeated his own intended purpose, seemingly
with the sheerest kind of stupid neglect. That he
had once loved her there could be no doubt, but the
possibility of his having reencouraged that love now
grew the remoter, in her estimation, with each attempted
move on his part to set aside, as presumable,
an established, developing progression.</p>
<p class="indent">A regime, however, that invited, till fixed and consolidated,
every upstart in the empire to try for
individual ascendency&mdash;a privilege the taiko would
not have denied any; he loved too well the pleasure
of crushing them. Yodogima would have so marshaled
her forces that none could disturb, but all
might rise in one united, orderly and elastic trend
toward a goal commonly beckoning back for the best
that God had given man. She had tested this Ieyasu
from a standpoint none other had been privileged, had
found out long ago Oyea&#146;s temper, if not her purpose,
and could not now, in face of the circumstances,
bring herself to believe that she, a mother;
Hideyori, her kind; the nation, at large; or an ideal,
that she had conceived, could endure the vagaries of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page210" id="page210"></a>[pg&nbsp;210]</span>
a man so attuned and advised as Ieyasu had proven
himself, whatever the sentiment.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Ishida,&#148; she surmised, &#147;will do only his part;
every man is born unto some righteous purpose.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">The messenger awaited her pleasure.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Comfort Maeda with the intelligence that I shall
come forthwith,&#148; replied the princess.</p>
<p class="indent">Ishida met her at the door:</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;You are too late, Yodogima! Maeda is dead.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">Ieyasu stood by, and with Ishida&#146;s addressing the
princess so familiarly a flush at first reddened his
face, then a cold pallor revealed the blow finding
lodgement in his heart.</p>
<p class="indent">Nor had Ishida&#146;s words roused in her lesser feelings;
more certainly of contempt. She had, perhaps,
at a fatal moment, unduly sacrificed her bearing toward
him, but she had judged him not manly, yet wiser
than to endanger himself by resolving a license
granted, into an indiscretion, possibly fatal to both
alike.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;You apparently take an undue advantage, Ishida;
please explain yourself,&#148; commanded the princess.</p>
<p class="indent">Ishida only laughed, whereat Yodogima turned
crimson.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Perhaps deeds better than words might compose
your ladyship. Suppose I name Harunaga; his
guardianship, over this boy Hideyori, should prove
to be no less willingly bestowed than agreeably
acceptable. What say you, Ieyasu; I understand
that your word, whatever the opinion, is of great
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page211" id="page211"></a>[pg&nbsp;211]</span>
weight, in some quarters, about matters domestic, if
not marriages politic. Come, craven; out with it,
before I shall have proven Harunaga innocent by
chopping your head off.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Cur,&#148; snapped Ieyasu, whipping out his sword;
&#147;Kitagira shall be guardian of Hideyori; I name
him.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;You are a coward, and an impossibility,&#148; shouted
Ishida, drawing to fight.</p>
<p class="indent">Yodogima forcibly threw herself between them:
why, she did not know; instinctively she believed
Ishida, the civilian, no match for Ieyasu, a veteran of
many battles. Neither one of them would harm her,
and their eyes gleamed the deadlier in consequence.
Konishi alone separated them, though by so doing, he,
too, gained an enmity that finally drove him irrevocably
into the camp of Ishida.</p>
<p class="indent">The captains had seen Yodogima, the favorite of
Hideyoshi and the mother of Hideyori, disgraced, and
they as willingly held Ishida at fault; his apparently
strange and rapid growth in favor, if not as suitor, at
Ozaka had roused their jealousies; the mysterious
death of Maeda, which none could attribute more to
Ishida than to Ieyasu, both alike detractors as well
as usurpers, now, in consequence of Yodogima&#146;s
apparent shielding&mdash;knowing, as they believed she
must know, the one&#146;s utter inequality&mdash;suddenly attached
itself to the former; Ishida had become
intolerable, for withal Ieyasu&#146;s faults, a samurai as
against a civilian should be condoned unto treachery&mdash;they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page212" id="page212"></a>[pg&nbsp;212]</span>
swore, then, and there, to take the life of
Ishida.</p>
<p class="indent">And Yodogima vowed, to herself, that they should
not; she had a reason: Ieyasu may or may not have
had, for on the spur of the moment he considered it
expedient or wise to hurry from the scene, hiding
himself away in a yakata (small house) near the palace
at Fushima.</p>
<p class="indent">There Ishida found him, as with hearing about the
captains&#146; determination to put an end to him, the
lovesick valet of former years had thrown himself
upon the mercies of none other than a master&#146;s widow.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Accept me, Yodogima,&#148; begged he; &#147;I am your
true lover, and will die for you.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;You mean, &#145;but for me,'&#148; suggested she, coldly.
Now I do not wish you death, nor shall I marry you:
I could not, as yet&mdash;I might say, for laughing; but, if
you do as I direct, I will see you safely from here.
Use this disguise, and reaching Fushima forthwith
subject yourself to the good will of Ieyasu; he may
protect you, but if you cannot hold your tongue I
should advise rather that you trust the captains;
they are less apt to procrastinate.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">Donning thus the guise of a bonze&mdash;he had, at all
events, professed Christianity&mdash;Ishida made off toward
Fushima fully determined to win the hand of
Yodogima, if not by valor, then with catering, for
withal his meanness he believed himself worth her
while.</p>
<p class="indent">Meeting Ieyasu at Bungo bashi (bridge), Ishida
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page213" id="page213"></a>[pg&nbsp;213]</span>
kneeled and craved his pardon. Ieyasu granted it;
he had sooner heard from Yodogima, at the hand
of a messenger, one of the captains, Honda Masanobu,
advising him: upon recalling a previous conversation:</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;I, too, have been considering whether it were best
to let the captains make way with Ishida or to save
him for further use.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Whose use,&#148; inquired Masanobu; &#147;your own,
or&mdash;&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;As you think, friend Masanobu,&#148; replied Ieyasu,
in the twinkling of an eye.</p>
<p class="indent">Thence Masanobu became a friend to Ieyasu,
and of the seven captains left by Hideyoshi, none was,
however alienated, actively engaged directly with
advancing the interests of Hideyori. Those who had
sworn to take the life of Ishida now deemed it obligatory
to cry umbrage at Ieyasu&#146;s saving him: between
the two of them, Ishida and Ieyasu, they all, but
Kuroda (who continued to remain absent) alike stood
ready and anxious to enter the ranks of the one or
the other madly to avenge a threatening wrong, on
either side attributable to a common cause, an assumably
attempted infringement upon the rights and
duties of the house Hideyoshi had builded.</p>
<p class="indent">Each of them, Ishida and Ieyasu&mdash;the only ones
whose ambitions seemingly conflicted with hers&mdash;had
sunk himself so deeply into the mire that no
rescue save a conflict could eradicate the danger of an
after consequence, and Yodogima quietly seated herself,
there, in Ozaka, apparently independent and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page214" id="page214"></a>[pg&nbsp;214]</span>
alone, upon a throne, perhaps builded by herself and
unthought of by the taiko or those sworn to do him
justice, ready to give and to take, frown or smile, as
occasion required and fortune betokened: and she
did as much, and more.</p>
<p class="indent">Ieyasu, refusing to listen to the captains, forthwith
sent Ishida to his keep at Sawayama. And that
none might do him harm on the way, or learn too
much about his liberties and movements after there,
he afforded his own son, Hideyasu, and a goodly
force, as well, for escort.</p>
<p class="indent">Thus licensed, Ishida lost no time in perfecting his
plans&mdash;as anticipated by Ieyasu, perchance encouraged
by another still higher in authority. Hideyasu
and his troops, at all events, had as expeditiously
returned to Fushima, and no restraint of whatsoever
kind hindered or enlightened the supposed past-master
now snugly domiciled at Sawayama.</p>
<p class="indent">Konishi, and others, including a portion of the
captains, stood behind Ishida; Takiyama, as many
daimyos, and the remaining captains, supported
Ieyasu: thus Christianity had been split, and found
itself uncharitably enrolled, each side preparing to
battle ostensibly for the same cause, an avowed safeguarding
of Hideyori&#146;s interests, but in reality the
preservation of an established religion, Buddhist or
Shintoist, whichever it were.</p>
<p class="indent">No one, however, so much as mentioned religion
in connection with the impending crisis; none professed
to seek political mastery; social conditions
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page215" id="page215"></a>[pg&nbsp;215]</span>
were apparently satisfactory, but the war fever spread
and the cry of everybody alike at once became, &#147;Preserve
the taiko&#146;s government.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">The princess verily laughed, and Ieyasu, Buddhist
incarnate, withdrew from the council and began concentrating
his forces at Yedo. Ishida, professing
Christianity, mobilized around Sawayama, and their
respective forces stood nearly equal. Thence Yodogima,
observant of every move, uninfluenced by their
claims or their charges, gathering and neutralizing
every malcontent, secure in her possessions and peaceably
inclined, quietly looked on and the nation
applauded.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;You are a dear, sweet child, Hideyori, and your
mother just worships you, lives only for you and
yours,&#148; whispered she, half to herself and half to the
snuggling, confiding boy; who had grown, already,
into a fine, dapper little chap, with the form and dash
of a Taira.</p>
<p class="indent">The mother, like others, no doubt admired her
son, but over and above this motherly instinct there
developed and ripened a determination to live in
him, to attain by and through him an ideality in keeping
with his lineage and their progression. Through
her he had inherited the manlier traits: sobriety and
the colder forces of an harmonious fellowship should
come of a careful tutoring, such as none else than
Harunaga could give; he, installed, as personal instructor,
immediately Yodogima had compromised
upon Kitagira&#146;s appointment for guardian, would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page216" id="page216"></a>[pg&nbsp;216]</span>
attend the pleasure only of a mother rightly judged,
measure truly a child&#146;s really inborn inheritance.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;How good it is to feel that one&#146;s energies are not
directed aimlessly,&#148; cogitated she, drawing the child
close in her arms. &#147;I can now understand what it
is to love intelligently. Yes, with precision. The
primal instincts are only foundation stones upon which
to rear a superstructure in keeping with our destiny.
A mother&#146;s love shorn of the father&#146;s ambition resolves
an anomaly. I must have verity.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Will you be to him as a father should be to a
child? Can you lay aside personality, submerge self
for the larger good, and make of this Hideyori what
birth and occasion demand?&#148; inquired the princess,
of Harunaga, who at her invitation sat there, sullenly
contemplating a situation that only he and she could
at all fathom in its deeper strata.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Discipline has been my due, and confidence is
your better prospect; if you believe me more than
human, then, and then only, can you trust me to do
what the world refuses; encourage others, at my own
expense,&#148; replied he, his eyes softening, with a love
broader than Ishida&#146;s, more comprehensive than
Hideyoshi&#146;s ever had been.</p>
<p class="indent">The child gambolled upon the greensward. Embattlements
here and there echoed the voice of security.
All around were things made and transient, as at the
inn where Hideyoshi had once shown himself to be a
man. The significance of authority now forged and
welded chords of deeper interest than the halo of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page217" id="page217"></a>[pg&nbsp;217]</span>
righteousness had deigned to conjure absolute, and
Yodogima looked afar over all these things in the
full consciousness of having found a man whom
she could trust. And she did trust him.</p>
<p class="indent">This man, invited and encouraged, had refused absolutely
to take advantage, and looking back over the
past how could she class him no higher than human?
Manhood were more; it savored of paradise, and
Yodogima paused there, if but to refresh the soul and
inspire its flight toward a higher fate.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;No, Harunaga,&#148; promised she, after a moment&#146;s
reflection, &#147;I do not trust anybody mortal, nor have
I confidence in any thing unrealized; but I understand
you; and in knowledge, primarily, there lies a
salvation. Be sponsor, that my child is your concern.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">Outside the ramparts, a savager duel engrossed
the activities of principals, seconds, and spectators
alike. The fife and drum fired men into heartier
doings, but none measured so accurately as did Yodogima
the final consequence: were she to fall short in
her estimate?</p>
<p class="indent">These were momentous deeds, of far-reaching
effect; all around them were civilizations and conditions
bordering upon the speculative, but none stood
seemingly as balanced as their own; China had ages
ago waded through its materialism, and again lapped
into spiritual inanimation; India had impoverished
itself with elaborate dogmas; Judea had lost its
nationality as a consequence of their religion; Greece
and its philosophy had fallen before the onslaught
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page218" id="page218"></a>[pg&nbsp;218]</span>
of a doctored creed; Rome had exhausted herself in
spreading that faith; the barbarous hosts of the
Northland, had, as yet, scarcely doffed the breach clot,
and only Spain, of these embryo nations, with her
cruelties, impossible barbarities, loomed large upon
the Western horizon.</p>
<p class="indent">All these things threshed out, searched for and
understood, before the days of Yodogima, she believed
that even they in their advanced position might profit
by maintaining some sort of intercourse with the
outside world; in fact, could not close their doors
to other men, however low in the scale of humanism,
so long as the God ideal held fast in the human heart.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;You are a Buddhist, Harunaga?&#148; inquired the
princess, after a pause.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Yes, your ladyship.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;And knowledge is the foundation of that belief?&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Yes, most honorable princess.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Then, why does Ieyasu refuse enlightment;
Christianity, like all religions, is but a means to that
end?&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Because it is vicious, and the prince would be
human,&#148; replied he, argumentatively.</p>
<p class="indent">Yodogima hesitated; she were treading upon sacred
grounds to answer, and answer she would. The
breath of a thousand, perhaps ten thousands, or more,
years floated in from a realized haven to fan the
flame of remembrance. This beauty land of theirs
she knew, stretching far and away, to the very limits
of an empire&mdash;carved and wrought of material perchance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page219" id="page219"></a>[pg&nbsp;219]</span>
as crude and hopeful as any other now struggling
as they once did&mdash;stimulated within her breast
a desire to extend a helping hand: the cold dread of
war, the cruel thirst for greed, the angry cry of,
&#147;On with the battle,&#148; behind it all, underlying the
activities out of which their culture had grown, froze
hard the blood in her veins.</p>
<p class="indent">Here were men blessed with plenty and endowed
of godliness still striking at each other; more artistically,
and effectively, but none the less cowardly for
that.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;What mean these men by fighting so?&#148; inquired
she, searching deeper than Harunaga had divined.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;To enforce a will,&#148; replied he, without any hesitation.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;To vindicate the soul?&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Yes.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Then it is not cowardly to use force, or its concomitant?&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;No.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;I did no wrong, if that is true, in visiting the
temple,&#148; mused she, unabatedly.</p>
<p class="indent">Harunaga flushed, then turned pale.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Not at all, your ladyship,&#148; replied he, to her
apparent satisfaction, though he knew very well that
Christianity had been the means of taking her there.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;You are not pained, are you, Harunaga, at what I
said?&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;How could I be, most honorable princess?&#148;</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page220" id="page220"></a>[pg&nbsp;220]</span>
&#147;Then hereafter say, &#145;Yodogima&#146;; I love to hear the
name.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">The personal note, whatever his predilection,
touched Harunaga, as no other had; from the days of
his childhood, in the service of Shibata, in far distant
Kitanoshi, he had formed only the component part of
a machine. The breath of life touched him, accordingly,
as none other had done. Here lived a princess,
possessing a mechanism most intricate, suffering the
discipline of enforced conditions, with all the limitations,
yet breathing the very spirit of humanitarianism.
If such as she could find a place in her heart
for the flame that enlivens, why not he grasp at a
spark?</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;I shall serve you, Yodogima, with all the vigor at
my disposal,&#148; promised he, ready at last to lay his
fortune where she had denied and her father commanded.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Then hark you, that none escape his mesh; these
barons shall be taught what it is to respect a woman.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">And&mdash;at least two of them were apparently placing
themselves in a position rapidly to learn something
of the cost as well.</p>
<p class="indent">Mori, of Hiroshima; Shimadzu, of Satsuma; Ukida,
of Bizen, and some thirty-five more of the eastern and
central daimyos had already joined the Ishida contingent
in the vicinity of Ozaka, observably, and a
formidable host, larger than she or anybody else had
anticipated, seemed gathering under the banner of
the one man, whom Yodogima down deep in her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page221" id="page221"></a>[pg&nbsp;221]</span>
heart detested, the very aspirant who had proffered a
deadly cup and coveted the hand of an intended victim&#146;s
widow, the deceiver then standing outside the
walls of her own castle crying, &#147;Long live Hideyori,&#148;
and, &#147;Death to Ieyasu.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">Ieyasu: the only man who had ever moved her!
Others appealed to the sense, to pride, and to consideration,
even love of a kind, yet, as events multiplied
and the time grew shorter, a living realization
momentarily overshadowed every expectation of hers;
the godlight again shone brighter than ever.</p>
<p class="indent">Must she stop this cruelty? Yodogima asked and
answered the question till burdened of its thought&mdash;she
could have ended it all, at least temporarily, she
believed&mdash;then gazed longingly at the child there in
her presence.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;What would you do, Hideyori, if set upon by
angry wolves?&#148; asked she, of the child, playfully.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Fight,&#148; responded he, with scarce another major
word at his tongue&#146;s use.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;I guess it&#146;s the nature of the beast,&#148; mused she,
pressing the boy closer up; &#147;and till subdued there
shall be need for gods as a God, so let them at it.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">The chances for success, however, against such
odds&mdash;growing rapidly with Ishida&#146;s popularity&mdash;seemed
almost beyond the possibilities of one, though
as capable as Ieyasu, and&mdash;were he to win, Christianity
must be doomed; she understood full well his
proclivities and surmised their inevitable result. And
Hideyori! Should Ishida win, then her own flesh and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page222" id="page222"></a>[pg&nbsp;222]</span>
blood must go the selfsame intended way that Hideyoshi
had barely escaped. She must, then, choose
between two evils: the present downfall of Christianity,
on the one hand, or the destruction of an
only living child, and that, too, a son, on the other.
An ideal at stake, with her, who had chosen differently?</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;You have my permission, Esyo, to visit this
Hideki, now that Oyea, his aunt, is dead and buried.
But, mind you, it is a privilege only, that your sister
grants&mdash;perhaps for a better reason than the one you
have in mind.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">Esyo sulked, but went nevertheless; her energies
were bent not upon completing the subversion of
Hideki from Ishida to Ieyasu, as contemplated by
Oyea, to the last, and now, perchance, thought of,
favorably, by Yodogima, as an expedient, but toward
a far more difficult and deeper reaching task: the substitution
of her own husband, Hidetada, for Hideyasu,
his elder brother, in favor with and as prospective
successor to Ieyasu, the father, whom she
already believed in a fair way to win and hold complete
mastership, socially and politically, yet, at heart,
would not condescend to acknowledge a kindness at
the hands of an elder, though most patient and fore-bearing,
sister.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Please do not trouble yourself; I am not so easily
read as Jokoin, thank you; besides, it is unnecessary;
I am quite capable, of doing as much, without anybody&#146;s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page223" id="page223"></a>[pg&nbsp;223]</span>
favor,&#148; snapped Esyo, hastily departing&mdash;none
too soon, however, to escape a danger that she little
contemplated, yet her sister had fully anticipated and
well enough avoided.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page224" id="page224"></a>[pg&nbsp;224]</span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXV</h2>

<p class="indent">The horrors of war crowded in and around: also
its exigencies. Self-preservation enforced
some kind of participation: the same elemental voice
bade her keep hands off. A fight to the death, perhaps
the victor stamping his imprint indelibly and unalterably,
awaited her: Yodogima sniffed the enamour of
contest, of powers gained and a will unhampered, and
the gods could not have swerved her in the test a
Taira, of ages gone, had fought for the pleasure.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;I will rule, and men shall bow to a force subtler,
fiercer, and mightier than any man has got,&#148; shouted
she, at her shadow, in the open, at Ozaka, and the
echo, from the hills at Sawayama, as well of Yedo,
burst back upon her their hitherto unchallenged
answer.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;It is false,&#148; cried she, this time, and the reply then
pleased her; it sounded more like the voice of a
man.</p>
<p class="indent">But she must not thus hurl defiance in his ears;
had she not been taught for centuries that woman&#146;s
strength lay in meekness, arose from humbleness,
grew with submission, abided the household, and
sweltered with servility?</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Ha, ha&mdash;fie on them!&#148; laughed she now, ashamed
of her own foolish recollections, so feeble-minded and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page225" id="page225"></a>[pg&nbsp;225]</span>
asinine withal. &#147;I&#146;ll invoke his tactics, but with a turn
he little comprehends.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">Both of these men, Ishida and Ieyasu, must be got
rid of. How to do it, were a problem. Ishida, it
seemed imperative, should be attended first; his force
had grown the stronger, and with Ieyasu out of the
way he himself would stand little in awe of her alone,
concerned not at all, as he was, about scruples or the
bushido. Still more, if needs use it Yodogima reckoned
her hold upon the heart of Ieyasu, whereas
Ishida in authority had been a colder, altogether
listless lover.</p>
<p class="indent">The clash of arms already sounded from distant
Aidzu, where Uyesuga, Ishida&#146;s main ally, had purposely
inaugurated a ruse to entice the enemy as far
from the capital as possible. Ieyasu fell into the
trap; went there pell mell, deploying but a small contingent
to guard the gates at Fushima: took with him
those captains of the old guard who had fairly joined
themselves to him, leaving their wives and families
behind, outside the ramparts at Ozaka. Ishida struck
first at Fushima: it fell, and the next move encompassed
the capture and imprisonment of these same
wives and families left at Ozaka, believing that their
ransom would insure to him the disaffection and
rejoinder of some of Ieyasu&#146;s leading generals and
supporters. Esyo, however, had gone; but Yodogima,
for good reasons, best known to herself, remained
as silent as the tomb of Hideyoshi had become.</p>
<p class="indent">Grace of Tango, the wife of Hosokawa, now one of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page226" id="page226"></a>[pg&nbsp;226]</span>
Ieyasu&#146;s foremost leaders, served at once as a first
and most likely victim. She, good Christian that she
was, scorned the distinction, and extending her neck&mdash;as
became a dutiful, loyal, loving wife&mdash;for the
stroke of a servant (prearranged by the thoughtful
husband, upon taking his leave), paid the penalty as
became her station, regardless of feeling or profession.
Made it possible for Ishida thus to blunder, and Yodogima
to endear the whole Christian fraternity, of whatsoever
camp or degree, by sympathizing with them in
the loss of one so good and true at heart, if not of
conviction. Nor did she stop at that alone, but
secretly dispatching her own sister, Jokoin, the sooner
to inform the hitherto somewhat wavering captains
as she herself had better designed, incidentally informing
them that no further bloodshed should take place
in the vicinity of Ozaka, upon the whole induced them,
one and all alike, to swear fresher, if more susceptible,
allegiance to Ieyasu&mdash;for the sole purpose, if
none other, of avenging the one death that had
resulted so pathetically, yet none the less opportunely.</p>
<p class="indent">Two definite accomplishments Yodogima had
wrought into the indiscretions of a foe&mdash;her seemingly
most dangerous one, Ishida; she had weakened
his position by uniting the men he had coveted the
more certainly to Ieyasu, and gained the everlasting
good will of all the Christians whatever the colors they
bore.</p>
<p class="indent">Ishida now concentrated upon Sekigahara, anticipating
the hot-headed return of Ieyasu and the sorely
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page227" id="page227"></a>[pg&nbsp;227]</span>
tried captains now in his advance. Mori remained
behind at Ozaka, ostensibly to watch the remainder
of those wives and families, finally fenced in and abandoned
to a gentler fate than at first contemplated.
Neither would he withdraw from the castle, save as
directed or encouraged by Yodogima; her company
had become, strangely to him, no less delectable than
the inkling of her plans (that she let slip, occasionally)
seemed inviting, or threateningly wholesome. Hideki
had followed, sulkily, to the contemplated battlefield,
though his conduct at Fushima might have signified,
to one more observant or less pressed than Ishida, that
Esyo or someone as anxious had called, not without
success, and gone her way, elsewhere to reap the
advantage.</p>
<p class="indent">Hideki, nevertheless, was assigned to an important
post on the right. Shimadzu half-heartedly manned
the left, Mori&#146;s brother&mdash;knowingly, of course&mdash;maintained
the advance (well off, at one side, however,
and in such position easily to &#147;slide&#148; in any direction),
while Konishi, master strategist and faithful adherent,
bore the brunt, in the center, where Ieyasu must
fight to pass.</p>
<p class="indent">And they came on, the veteran Ieyasu in the lead,
a hundred thousand of them, with Hideyasu, his main
reliance and intended successor, in the rear, commanding
a reserve, something like half as strong.</p>
<p class="indent">But these failed to arrive, this flower in repose and
the favorite of his father; Esyo had discreetly
inveigled him into an encounter at one side, with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page228" id="page228"></a>[pg&nbsp;228]</span>
Sanada, the fiery youth whom she had unknowingly
and as witlessly inveigled into the taking of sides
against her own father-in-law.</p>
<p class="indent">The battle thus began and raged, at Sekigahara,
without the aid or prospect of Hideyasu. Ieyasu,
angered at the failure of his trusted progeny, charged
in person, took every risk of defeat, and Yodogima,
threatened with the consequence, invoking a last
resource, sent forthwith for Mori, saying:</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Advise your brother to hasten here; I can better
serve him with Ieyasu than with Ishida.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">No further encouragement need she use, for these
were not fighting men; Hideyoshi had previously
taught them the greater potency of diplomacy. But
Hideki!</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Jokoin?&#148; commanded Yodogima.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;I am here, sister.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Can you reach Ieyasu?&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Certainly,&#148; replied she, as confident as in the days
of Kamakiyama.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Then tell Ieyasu to fire upon Hideki. He will
inquire the reason, but you are to reply that Yodogima
commands it.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">Jokoin did as bid, and Ieyasu pondered why; Esyo
had advised him of a different understanding, but
somehow he could not resist the lure of Yodogima.
Time were precious, just now, too much so to waste
it parleying with self, so the order was given: Hideki,
stunned and driven, rallied his men and wheeling
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page229" id="page229"></a>[pg&nbsp;229]</span>
joined his would-be confederate, Ieyasu, and the
battle was won.</p>
<p class="indent">None but Yodogima knew how it had been done or
the disaffection brought about, but there was one who
down in his heart bled at the failure of a son and
would hearken only the savior of Sekigahara. Ishida
routed and butchered, Ieyasu turned as hastily toward
Ozaka.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page230" id="page230"></a>[pg&nbsp;230]</span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVI</h2>

<p class="indent">Marching down the valley, set with peaceful
homes, disturbed only by the retreating fragments
of a broken and routed army, twice the size
of his but then endangered advance, Ieyasu marvelled
the instability, the pliableness, the simplicity,
and withal the potency of man.</p>
<p class="indent">The mountains around sat upon their base, unmovable,
except at the cost of total annihilation; vegetation
retained its vitality, till stricken from the root giving
sustenance; wild beasts at bay, fought unto death.
But man, he above all others, turned his heels at the
commonest occasion, more than any other creature
here on earth stupidly hearkened the devil, willingly
disobeyed the divinest of injuncts, &#147;know thyself.&#148;
It resolved that the more his liberty were granted the
less intelligence he retained; and yet a new civilization
had come to their door, knocking, and carrying
with it seeds of discontent, quarrelling over methods
of government, as unsettled about the origin of man
as uncertain of God&#146;s (Kami&#146;s) prevision.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Away with such nonsense,&#148; threatened he, traveling
along, fully resolved. &#147;These hills and valleys
have held to the truer doctrine since Izanagi and
Izanami (the god and the goddess principles positive
and negative), meeting upon the floating bridge of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page231" id="page231"></a>[pg&nbsp;231]</span>
heaven, did as God (Kami) willed, placing man upon
this earth to do and survive His edict and that only.
Speculate as you will, man hears no ultimate relation
to the things placed here for his use and sustenance.
He is descended from above: let the jungle answer to
his call; intelligence looks heavenward: the throne
unmistakably echoes the voice of God.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">And in that revelation, as before, perfumed with the
creeping, sheltering azalea, Ieyasu discerned the
hand of Yodogima. He would now hasten to her and
claim what then he had the courage to refuse. God
had preserved her for him and him for her. The
failure of Hideyasu, his own son, had come as a fitting
rebuke to the devil lurking underneath: his soul at last
seemed purified; the fragrance, the divinity of love now
found within a befitting response; the mind cleared in
its vision, strengthened of a will untarnished, the
soul cried out, livid and alluring&mdash;God had willed
him great, and in that love, which had not once failed
him, the godhead unfolded atop that it is not a
province or pleasure to doubt and question.</p>
<p class="indent">Christianity had set up faith as gospel, which had
fallen at the first stand; courage faced it, divided
them, and crushed theirs: his edict alone should suffice
to banish as much forever from the land: what
more the breath of a goddess; one fraught with the
inspiration of victory; a living example of the divinity
of man; the very incarnation of purity; her transcendant
ideal worthy of his most uncompromising
sanctity&mdash;Ieyasu, penitent, in the face of all that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page232" id="page232"></a>[pg&nbsp;232]</span>
had gone before, regardless of doubting men&#146;s opinions
or the carping tongues of unfitted women, still
believed Yodogima inviolate: held her incapable of
word or deed suggestive though befitting.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;My foot is upon the dragon&#146;s neck: appear, goddess
divine; it is I who speaks!&#148; commanded he, halting
at the mountain&#146;s crest, overlooking the spreading
valley, where reposed the harbinger of his fancied
haven.</p>
<p class="indent">The hero of Sekigahara had dreamed before, husbanded
a love absorbing virtues as intense, but never
had reality seemed as close as now. Fired at the
thought of mastery, he would drink deeper than
ideality had bidden, quaff at last the golden elixir of a
realized fount, bring down to earth heaven&#146;s supremest
joy and trend thence the glad onrush with the prize of
living securely resting willingly and unbidden in his
arms.</p>
<p class="indent">The heavens over him rent in twain, and out of the
once unfathomed gap there streamed the warmth and
radiance of Amaterasu, grand, inspiring, and withal so
promising. The light of love cast its halo over the
peaceful, towering walls of Ozaka: the face of Yodogima
stood out smilingly against a background of blue
there reflected, overset the dark, envisaged canopy of
time sweltering and seething underneath.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;She is mine&mdash;God, she is mine!&#148; swore he, stamping
down the hill-slope, his veins dilated, and expression
overjoyed.</p>
<p class="indent">There, in the sunlight, high over the emblazoned
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page233" id="page233"></a>[pg&nbsp;233]</span>
embattlements, with the gates closed, an army of
faithful defenders, at either side, overhead, and at
every turret stationed, the hills and valley responding
to the glad visitation of now rapidly receding, romping
rain clouds, Yodogima pleasingly returned that
message which holds dearer than life the truth of
existence.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;It is he!&#148; cried she, &#147;God knows that I love him&mdash;see!
He has made the very elements oblivious to
any denial. Oh, Ieyasu; fail me not. What are
these dead and living things, but for you? Hasten,
oh hasten; dread moments fly; he comes; bravo!&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">Hurrying maids, and mirrors, and treasures dear,
told the welcome that then awaited his coming.
Cranes white as snow stalked lazily in the reed
marshes, and flowers precious perfumed the gardens
in readiness. Spotless floors and walls of golden
lacquer again hushed with expectancy. There were
cuckoos now of rarest note, and banks and borders of
geishas to enliven every step, and charm&mdash;the soul
poured out its abundance, the heart trembled at only
thought, the mind waxed eager and resplendent, and
the tongue failed her:</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Come, oh come&mdash;my lover, come!&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">Down at the gates, across the moats, underneath the
outer walls, of those triple terraced embankments,
from the housed-over plain at the bottom, to the
terraced enclosures above, an ardent, anxious, confident
man rapped impatiently, hotly, daringly for admission.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page234" id="page234"></a>[pg&nbsp;234]</span></p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Who comes there?&#148; rang out huskily, at the
tunnelled-out entrance.</p>
<p class="indent">Ieyasu paused; the defiance seemed as if from
below. No such sound had disturbed his fancied right
since the days when a worthier blade dared invoke the
blessings of denial, and the dull grindings of an indiscernable
machine, the tireless demands of an unfaltering
conventionality, startled him into questioning
verily the survival of anything.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;There must be some mistake,&#148; ventured he, coldly
pondering the consequence of his arrest.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;No; there is none,&#148; answered the keeper, in order;
&#147;travellers should make sure that they are prepared,
before seeking entrance to a strange place; the princess,
Yodogima, resides within, and as observed you
have come a long way, with a large retinue, and must
be desirous of some rest and recreation. Pray you,
keep without, till quite ready; the princess just now
implores: I command it.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;But I am not a stranger here: the princess wills
me enter.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Just so. Therefore look you well that deed and
will carry corresponding virtues, before the one lower
in consequence invokes another higher in authority.
Come, prepare yourself; it has been done, before.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Ieyasu waits on none; I have the means at hand
to enforce my way.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;So you have, but consider first the defence; no man
passes here except at his peril.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">Ieyasu withdrew, and Kyogoku reported the circumstance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page235" id="page235"></a>[pg&nbsp;235]</span>
to his superior, Kitagira; who had dispatched
him for his audacity had not Jokoin appeared
to prevent it; Ieyasu had sent her in to inquire the
reason of his refusal; she, counseling Yodogima,
sought to fasten the blame upon Kitagira; thus saving
her own husband, for purposes of her own, at the expense
of Kitagira, an innocent man; whom Ieyasu
forthwith insisted should be dismissed and banished,
before himself consenting to an audience with Yodogima;
having sooner effected his own entrance past
Kyogoku in the disguise of a woman&#146;s palanquin.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Ieyasu refuses to see me, except the child&#146;s guardian
be dismissed?&#148; repeated Yodogima, thoughtfully.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;That is the advice,&#148; replied Harunaga, who had
interceded to save Kitagira.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Then let Kitagira produce Ieyasu; here, in
audience; he has the force with which to do it: if
he have not the courage, why, then, Ieyasu may dismiss
him; I have, as it is, really no occasion for doing
so&mdash;but, I want to see Ieyasu.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">Kitagira vacillated; he believed Harunaga&#146;s growing
influence over Hideyori and estimate by the
mother unwarranted, and would have married Yodogima
to Ieyasu at once had he not discerned in that
the ultimate defeat of Hideyoshi, the deceased taiko&#146;s
succession. Said he, to Hayami Morihisa, a captain
of the Ozaka guard:</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Ieyasu plans to wed Yodogima and substitute
himself in authority over Hideyori: what we must do
is to gain time. Let him take her as hostage, if he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page236" id="page236"></a>[pg&nbsp;236]</span>
choose, but see to it that no marriage take place while
the son is yet under age. Hideyori is an intelligent
lad, and capable of crushing Hidetada or any other
of Ieyasu&#146;s descendants, but in the meantime, we
should let Ieyasu die; to go against him now, with
the crushed and defeated Christians acknowledging
Ozaka&#146;s protection, would be but to invite defeat; the
daimyos and captains of established faith would, to a
man, rally to the cause of Ieyasu.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">You reason well, Kitagira,&#148; replied Hayami, thereat
approved in what he said by the remainder of the
seven captains, &#147;but Harunaga, as a man, could not
recommend it, and his advice is paramount at court.
Nor would, nor should the daimyos submit to Yodogima&#146;s
virtual imprisonment; the taiko never contemplated
any such irreverence, and I am sure that she,
herself, to-day, with a voice unequalled by any other,
among all classes, throughout the land, once able to
resist Hideyoshi, himself, as she was, would hardly
consent to a degradation of the sort you suggest, or
so belittle herself and those dependent upon her as
to fawn favors for or of anybody. I shall advise
Harunaga of your plans and let him decide; he stands
best in favor with Yodogima.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">And he did so, forthwith.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;It is a make-believe,&#148; replied she, to Harunaga,
who had related the proposal, truthfully and unreservedly;
&#147;Ieyasu is not so much to fear&mdash;yet I shall
not dismiss Kitagira; he is a creature of Ieyasu&#146;s,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page237" id="page237"></a>[pg&nbsp;237]</span>
and my best and only pawn. Does Ieyasu still refuse
me a visit?&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Yes, my dear.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Please do not call me &#145;dear&#146;; it is enough to retain
one&#146;s confidence in men, without their overstepping
bounds granted. But this Ieyasu: where is he now,
that he can refuse?&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Inside the castle grounds, and not so very far distant,
either, your ladyship.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Not &#145;your ladyship&#146;, Harunaga; I said it should
be &#145;Yodogima&#146;&mdash;I do believe the world itself shall
sooner or later grow into a veritable machine.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Yodogima!&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;That is more to my liking. Why everybody or
anybody so impersonal? But Ieyasu: I shall go to
him, he refusing to come to me: perhaps Kitagira
may thus retain his head, and I my lover. What think
you, Harunaga?&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;I am at your service.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;And I can trust you; results are the best sort of
proof.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">The fires had by this time considerably abated, and
out of the glowing embers there burned a warmth as
steady and as sure as the reactional beating back
upon a passionate ordainedly evolves within life&#146;s
exultant strand. Ieyasu sulked, and Yodogima took
heart; his brow darkened, and her intention waxed
the brighter; had his will been permitted, her lot
need not have been resolved, for he would have her
shorn of every influence but his; he believed her pure,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page238" id="page238"></a>[pg&nbsp;238]</span>
and out of his blamelessness and its correlative demands
had come reflection: making it possible for
Yodogima to decide upon revealing the exact light in
which she responded&mdash;the only meed of a living
affinity.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;I hope I find you comfortable, and&mdash;&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;In a good humor,&#148; responded he, to her half
spoken address; barely turning to recognize her, as
she approached, considerately; bowing as became her
and the niceties of the situation prompted.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Yes,&#148; replied she, unabashed; &#147;I am, and why
should Ieyasu not be in as fair mood?&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Perhaps I ought to be, but I cannot quite bring
myself to believe that I am as deserving. You make
sport with me, I do so myself, and the world is no
different than we.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;It is more alluring, however, I take it, in the
case of some than of others. Look underneath the
smiles, Ieyasu; it is not all gold that glitters; perchance
my heart may have bled, is bleeding this very
minute; do not consider me happy, till&mdash;&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;I am out of the way,&#148; interceded he, not one whit
thawed or observant.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Look at me,&#148; commanded she, her very frame
racking with a passion that he, in his coldness, had
not the power to comprehend.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;You do love me, then,&#148; stammered Ieyasu,
ravenously reading the words so lengthily written for
his dull eyes to feast faun-like upon.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page239" id="page239"></a>[pg&nbsp;239]</span>
&#147;Love you? I presume you know what it is to
love? I do.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Yodogima! Forgive me,&#148; plead he, the clouds
vanishing as they had gathered: uncontrolled and
misapprehended.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Yes; but not with the assurance you possess,&#148;
replied Yodogima, more anxious to divulge than he
were ready to exact, now, any secret incapable of
ingraining or outliving a nature as commonplace as his.</p>
<p class="indent">The princess had seated herself, at leisure, a little
in front of the rapidly recovering lover, whose ardor
would again have bordered the extreme had not her
last admonition once more set him thinking. But
Ieyasu&#146;s mind moved like a tortoise, and Yodogima
flushed a little, no doubt at the prospect of having to
reach a bit deeper into that unthinkable comprehension
of his&mdash;with which she had wrestled mostly since
their meeting underneath the really suggestive
azalea.</p>
<p class="indent">Ieyasu observed, however, the one indiscretion,
and would have bowed to the mat, at her feet&mdash;no
closer contact being permitted, either in heart or at
will, by the bushido and of choice&mdash;but for Yodogima&#146;s
further cautioning:</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Pray do not prostrate yourself; the victor may
not prove to have been worthy.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">Ieyasu held himself, sat there in bended fashion,
considering half-doubtfully, half-consciously the warning.
A thousand possibilities leaped to the fore, suddenly
and provokingly. Had he been wrong, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page240" id="page240"></a>[pg&nbsp;240]</span>
her detractors truthful; were she clever, and he over-trustful;
did some terrible revelation parch those lips
he had sworn divine; or was it the idle mockings of
his own brutal response that troubled her and mystified
him?</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Tell me, Yodogima&mdash;no, no; you must not; it
would kill me; it is not true; they speak falsely&mdash;shall
this weapon vindicate me, or you, Yodogima; you
have but to nod the head, and spare your lips!&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Ha, ha, ha&mdash;Ieyasu! Put away that knife and
invoke a wit. I should never have guessed you half
so sentimental. Why, I do believe you would make a
martyr of yourself, or me&mdash;who wouldn&#146;t be at all
worth the trouble. Come; sit down again; let us
reason it out; one drop of blood is, after all, worth
a lot of nobleness&mdash;as codes are written in these
times.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;I&#146;ll never sit down, till you declare them false&mdash;that
you are determined to talk, as all women are. Nor
have I anything to gain, at my age, by reasoning;
acting is all important, whatever the point, now that
the end crowds fast upon me. Shout it if you like,
but consider well the effect.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;I shall do nothing of the kind. Take care of your
own shattered prospects; I have all I can do to bear
with you, let alone conserve your ease. You deny
me the privilege of explaining, hence defeat me of a
duty I had intended performing.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Oh, well; I can presume as much.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;If you like, pray do.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page241" id="page241"></a>[pg&nbsp;241]</span>
&#147;I shall.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Then what?&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Go.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;And why?&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Because you are lost.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Then I but knock in vain!&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Christianity is responsible for it, not I&mdash;understanding
had saved the need of forgiveness.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Perhaps; but I should advise you, if advice be
meet, to listen; there may not be, after all, so much to
choose, between knowledge and faith. Have you no
other estimate?&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;No; nor do I want one; I am satisfied.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;And I am pained; yet I have faith: were &#145;knowing&#146;
my only asset, I should shut you in, here, till
good and done with you; I, too, might make some
sordid use of a plaything, but there are larger compensations
in store for those who look more charitably
upon their brothers: therefore I dismiss you,
with a suitable escort hence.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">Ieyasu went as permitted and directed.</p>
<p class="indent">Had she driven her lover from her? Should she
have accepted him on faith, granted his unchallenged
desire, and ignored truth? Might either passive, or,
if needs be, active lying have resolved better their
happiness? Could heaven be attained without knowledge?
Buddhism said no; Christianity claimed yes,
but deeper than these, broader than either, more compelling
than any other, Yodogima&#146;s religion searched,
expanded, and enforced truth&#146;s unclaimed adherence.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page242" id="page242"></a>[pg&nbsp;242]</span>
And yet, how attain it? In denying him, she had
falsified: in accepting she had done more: how reduce
the blessings of God&mdash;infinite, all-compulsory?</p>
<p class="indent">The very thought of her great sin overbore Yodogima
with a determination to survive any test. The
walls around her resounded with a growth and a
strength fairly laughing to scorn the very desirability
of absolution&mdash;Ieyasu had done right, and
yet erred; Christ filled a void, at least, and for that
should not be cast upon.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;I&#146;ll live down the wrong I&#146;ve done,&#148; mused she,
&#147;and when it&#146;s absolved with the blood shed of my
own veins, there&#146;ll be no need of condonations, and
faith, hope, and charity, knowledge, uprightness or
consideration, the state, the church, and the castes,
shall have vanished in the stead of one united and
indivisible brotherhood, where sin and sorrow, the
virtues and the joys are no longer remembered of
man.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">The countenance of her fathers looked down from
an old kakemono (picture) hanging from the wall,
behind the shrine, above the potted pine, with kindly
expression.</p>
<p class="indent">The princess gazed long and earnestly thereat, then
said to herself:</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;You, too, shall vanish, and all that we prize or
hate of this earth shall have sometime proven itself
of no more final consequence than the slenderest reed
that grows and withers with the rising and the setting
of the sun. My little sins and virtues, his, and theirs,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page243" id="page243"></a>[pg&nbsp;243]</span>
will then resolve and not abide the existence of a
soul. God himself shall stand revealed, and the world
attain its destined end&mdash;a heaven here where men are
doomed, and none denied, of treasures yet undreamed.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">Sitting within the confines of her own allotted environment,
far removed from the turmoils of rendering,
shorn of creation&#146;s compensatory appeal, but
clothed with the choicer products of highest endeavor,
Yodogima, too, pondered the complexity of human
nature, and its languor or celerity in rendering the
tidy milestones so highly prized or bitterly condemned
as we go. Yet, unlike Ieyasu, she had partaken
thereof a self-suffered resignation. What the consequence?</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page244" id="page244"></a>[pg&nbsp;244]</span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVII</h2>

<p class="indent">For the other, there seemed but a single course.
He had exhausted, as it would appear, all the
avenues open to him but one. No such thing as
being born again had entered into Ieyasu&#146;s curriculum,
and the very tenets of his religion scorned the
lesser beatitudes of a troubled soul. Stoicism had
survived mercy, and his goddess profaned the world
must answer.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Concentrate at Fushima,&#148; commanded he, of Hidetada,
now his favorite, and most trusted commander.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;But Hideyasu is intractable: refuses to obey Hidetada,
his younger,&#148; replied Esyo, before Hidetada,
her husband, could make any answer.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Then let him be humbled; I declare Hidetada my
successor, and do invest him with supreme authority
under me,&#148; declared Ieyasu; Esyo withdrawing to
convey the intelligence, to her displaced brother-in-law,
with all the force and color at her tongue&#146;s end.</p>
<p class="indent">A thousand regiments stood ready to assemble and
fight under Ieyasu&#146;s colors, and no daimyo of position
would raise the feeblest protest&mdash;though fully
cognizant of the motive and bitterly regretting the
coup&mdash;against the cry of:</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Out with the Christians!&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">The edict had gone forth, and regardless of Ieyasu&#146;s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page245" id="page245"></a>[pg&nbsp;245]</span>
intent no loyal defender, not a supporter of
the taiko&#146;s regime, much less any true believer in the
mikado, had failed to respond to a call so vital to their
existence, as obnoxious to their ways of living and
welfare in death. Those godly men, the priests, and
their converts, by word and by deed, had proven themselves
marauders and evil-boding. They had reached
over men&#146;s consciences, struck at the state, and meddled
with the home&mdash;and for what? To substitute
one religion for another&mdash;and why?</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;To gratify ambition,&#148; replied Ieyasu, and for once
Christianity found a foe worthy its steel.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;This stupid pilot&#146;s inadvertent speech, he of the
<i>San Felipe</i>, however petty, but echoes the cornerstone
of a philosophy, disguised and spread as religion,
intended to profit the sophisticated at the expense
of the confiding,&#148; continued he, reasoning with the
court at Kyoto. &#147;Why, they are already sniffling at
the largest treasury in the empire, seek under the
guise of patriots to invest the strongest fortress left
us, and are poisoning the mind, as they abused a reliance,
of our departed taiko&#146;s widow, the princess
Yodogima; than whom, till their withering touch
defiled, none better, purer, or more faithful lived.
Give me this appointment, I say; influence our
beloved mikado to make me shogun&mdash;Yoshiaki is
dead and Minamoto blood is in me&mdash;and I shall
oust them and close these doors to the world. Then,
and not till then, shall peace reign in this most favored
and only blessed domain.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page246" id="page246"></a>[pg&nbsp;246]</span>
Enthusiasm bore them on, as it always does, when
founded well, however conceived, and Ieyasu thereat
became shogun&mdash;an honor Hideyoshi had striven all
his life, yet died to see lowering upon another.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;It proves nothing,&#148; continued Ieyasu, shrugging
his shoulders, &#147;except the value of blood, establishes
the divinity of the mikado, and preserves to us the
religion we know resolves in practice what it preaches.
I pronounce it.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">Not so at Ozaka; Yodogima had looked as far into
the working of social, religious, and political complexities
as the sage of Yedo had thought to enter;
understood the <i>San Felipe</i> threat equally as well, but
regarded it rather as a source, not as much as any
sort of finality&mdash;Yodogima knew better the hearts of
men; as a woman, she had had an experience that no
man can have: she believed that Ieyasu&#146;s act in seeking
the shogunate were no less personal than had been
Hideyoshi&#146;s purpose in denying her the privileges of
an inherent love; than the king of Spain&#146;s motive was
mercenary in speeding forth the missionaries.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;With transportation established, there is no end
to greed, and Japan, if she would live, must open, and
not close her doors. Does Ieyasu think that God in
his wisdom were so narrow as to exempt this tiny
spot from the responsibilities and compensations
everywhere else around us borne?&#148; said the princess,
to Hideyori, who had grown to respect his mother&#146;s
advice, and now sought it, before answering Ieyasu&#146;s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page247" id="page247"></a>[pg&nbsp;247]</span>
importuning him to proceed thither and do homage
to the newly made shogun&#146;s attempted precedence.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;For every missionary sent to us,&#148; continued she,
&#147;let us send two to them; as they build ships, then
double their output; if it is with arms they would
grab, we have more than twice their number, the
largest of them, and discipline to spare. Go against
them my child; possession is the secret, and the fittest
shall survive; it is God&#146;s law, and woe unto him who
disobeys&mdash;Ieyasu as well; he has denied me, and let
come what may your mother will be vindicated.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">Hideyori had just arrived at earliest manhood, and
little did he care about anything so inane and deceptive
as enforced peace, as unequal and degrading as
discriminative prosperity. The old stock, the spirit
of an age that did not lie, of men unstooped to a
progress that would rob Peter to pay Paul, a civilization
that had brought the West&#146;s proudest knocking
at their doors, made them the coveted of all continents,
these aspirations burned at his finger tips.</p>
<p class="indent">A mother had been wronged: what more could have
fired a lesser zeal?</p>
<p class="indent">Trained by a man whose only thought was of his
best interests, loved dearly by one who had given him
being, applauded by a multitude, endowed of an
authority, heir to vast treasures and supported by men
of valor&mdash;who could have resisted the challenge to
honor a name?</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Hideyori respects the honorable Ieyasu, but cannot
concede him the rank or authority claimed,&#148; was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page248" id="page248"></a>[pg&nbsp;248]</span>
the modest though significant answer returned, by
the insulted heir to an exalted taiko&#146;s prestige.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;I am pleased,&#148; promised Ieyasu, to Kitagira,
directly his own best trusted intermediary; &#147;Hideyori&#146;s
refusal affords me the opportunity&mdash;awaited
all these barren years.&#148;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVIII</h2>

<p class="indent">And with bated breath those captains, now scattered
and broken, looked on, powerless to see
and helpless to act. Yodogima threw open her doors to
the patriots: Ieyasu closed his against all but the
wise, and no such cloud had risen since the days of
Ashikaga.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;My daughter shall not become the wife of this
stripling, Hideyori,&#148; declared Esyo, at the shogun&#146;s
repeated threat.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Yes she will,&#148; replied he, coldly considering the
prospects, from another standpoint altogether.</p>
<p class="indent">Esyo stared balefully at the floor, and Ieyasu
labored watchfully the trend of her reasoning; he
would not force the issue at Ozaka, not just yet, and he
knew that Yodogima would regard her sister&#146;s feelings.
A cloud, also, had risen in the direction of
Jokoin. The banishment of the Christians had roused
her ire, particularly as Takiyama had been ordered
into seclusion, and with both sisters, his own sons,
the Christians, and Yodogima against him the small
prospect at hand of squeezing out the house of Hideyoshi
would be forever dissipated.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;I am an old man, Esyo,&#148; said he, after a short
reflection, &#147;and would make Hidetada my successor;
suppose I do it now; resign, and persuade his appointment
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page250" id="page250"></a>[pg&nbsp;250]</span>
instead, as shogun; would it be asking too much
in that event, to expect your reasonable consent to
this marriage?&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">Esyo deliberated. It had been her one ambition
from the day she landed in Hideyoshi&#146;s camp, a victim
if a meddler. Would she quit the pleasure of frustrating
Yodogima, as she believed, to gain the eminence
so long and craftily sought? The bare thought of
needing to decide pained her; she would have snatched
both, the gratification and the honor, but this Ieyasu,
her father-in-law, the shogun, had never been pressed
to extremes, while in a corner, and she faltered.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Upon one condition,&#148; concluded she, presently.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;That seems fair,&#148; chanced he; &#147;what is it?&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;That you kill Hideyori.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Before, or after?&#148; inquired the shogun, without
so much as smiling.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Presumably you may think it as easily done,&#148;
retorted she, the pride of blood, for the nonce, asserting
some sort of peculiar sway.</p>
<p class="indent">The Taira, however, had measured swords with the
Minamoto centuries before Esyo inadvertently condescended
to vouchsafe this one lonely thrill, and
Ieyasu perhaps, therefore, sooner learned to attend
the reckoning that awaited him, in this his final effort
to dislodge an intrepid foe. Were the last fight to
have been fought with a man, the battle-scarred
Ieyasu had buckled on his armor, and gladly; but
look as he might, heed whom he chose, Yodogima,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page251" id="page251"></a>[pg&nbsp;251]</span>
a love of his and an offspring of theirs, rose up, out
of the smoldering embers, to bid and to challenge.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;My God! I cannot face her&mdash;oh, yes; I can;
she is nothing to me&mdash;curse the Christians! I&#146;ll slay
them&mdash;&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;No you won&#146;t,&#148; threatened Jokoin, in her way,
having entered shortly after Esyo&#146;s withdrawal, in
the course of the hearer&#146;s meditation; &#147;they&#146;ve got
powder to burn, of a right good quality&mdash;just in from
Hirado, the foreigners&#146; hold out&mdash;and a pound of it
is worth a lot of valor&mdash;&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;I&#146;ll double the price; tell your friends that Ieyasu
is in the market for powder.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;And a wife, as well. But you can&#146;t have Yodogima;
she&#146;s given you the mit.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Silence, child; will you never use modesty; you
are in the presence of the shogun?&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Oh, I wonder&mdash;indeed I&#146;m not; you have no right
to be shogun, and what isn&#146;t right isn&#146;t; there now!
I shall take my orders from Hideyori: perhaps marry
him, if Takiyama, Goto, Sanada, and all the rest worth
while&mdash;&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;You have a husband.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;So have you a wife; and, what is more, my husband
is willing; and, I am sure, you can&#146;t say as much;
and, better still, Esyo wants her daughter to marry
Kyogoku&mdash;don&#146;t you think you could use him; he
is as good as forty women, at that?&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Kyogoku! Perhaps&mdash;he may know more about
them than I do,&#148; sighed the shogun, hopelessly entangled,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page252" id="page252"></a>[pg&nbsp;252]</span>
undoing the riddle she had unwound for his
special edification. &#147;I&#146;ll let you off, however; though,
I ought to send you as company for Takiyama.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Send me? I&#146;d like to see you do it; banish me, if
you dare!&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;I&#146;ll harness the whole of you, if you don&#146;t mind
your p&#146;s and q&#146;s. And to convince you that I mean
just what I say I am this very day going to send the
infant daughter of Hidetada, together with a retinue,
to Ozaka. No doubt you yourself will have advised
Hideyori&mdash;whom I have had appointed Nai-dai-jin&mdash;in
advance something of my expectations so that
he may be prepared to take my granddaughter as
wife upon arrival. I shall, out of consideration for
you, forego any more forceful intelligence.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;He shall do nothing of the kind, is not a nai-dai-jin,
nor will Yodogima harbor your spies&mdash;not if I can
prevent it. Neither do I care to be bored with your
concern for me.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Oh, ho&mdash;there are worse lovers.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;None as inane, whom I know.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Tut, tut&mdash;louder and more of it.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;You haven&#146;t begun to hear from me.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;No?&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;N-o-o-?&mdash;I&#146;m off.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">The shogun had not misjudged Jokoin, in the least,
yet did not wish at all to enforce any kind of restraint.
Unable to fathom Esyo, there was danger of estranging
Hidetada himself&mdash;for the wife had quite dominated
and held him verily subject to her own stronger
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page253" id="page253"></a>[pg&nbsp;253]</span>
will&mdash;while Hideyasu, not yet wholly without some
influence, still refused to become entirely reconciled
to his naturally unexpected displacement. There
were, also, rumors around that certain of the captains
and daimyos who had sided with him as against Ishida
were growing nervous about his attitude toward the
taiko&#146;s heir. Whether it were because of their own jealousies,
or due to Yodogima&#146;s influence, he could not
satisfactorily determine, as indited; he had rewarded
them all, liberally, for their services, if deserving, while
the princess had estranged some by her friendliness
to Harunaga; whatever the case the breach must be
held over till his forces had been raised and insured
to the likelihood of Yodogima&#146;s. His contention
about the Christians had enthused the populace, but
open hostilities against Hideyori, so soon after, would
certainly lose him the advantage at first gained.</p>
<p class="indent">Diplomacy were his most available instrument, just
then, however drastic the conclusive threshing.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Are you certain about this boy, Hideyori&#146;s incapacity,
Kitagira?&#148; inquired he&mdash;soon after Jokoin had
left&mdash;doubtfully. &#147;You have persistently told me
that he were no match for Hidetada; I should like to
know, of my own knowledge; cannot you arrange a
meeting?&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;One thing at a time, my lord; if he marry your
granddaughter, what better proof need anyone?&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Just so. Therefore see you that the marriage take
place.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">Kitagira made no answer, but drawing his own
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page254" id="page254"></a>[pg&nbsp;254]</span>
conclusions, from that last answer, as to the shogun&#146;s
own capableness, trudged off toward Ozaka, with the
intentionally betrothed in his arms, fully decided upon
escaping to his own miserably allotted fief, should he
fail of the mission imposed.</p>
<p class="indent">At Ozaka a storm of protest went up from all but
Yodogima. She had threatened something worse.
Esyo arriving first, Jokoin after, and the trundled
granddaughter lastly, everybody had had ample occasion
to hit upon something&mdash;save alone Ieyasu;
who by remaining at home surveyed better the feelings
engendered with the ruse.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Take the brat away,&#148; shouted Kyogoku, still vigilant
at the gate.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;No,&#148; commanded Yodogima; &#147;let the mother decide;
she is present, and of right should elect a daughter&#146;s
husband.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;I can save you trouble,&#148; suggested Hideyori; reluctantly,
however, for the baby looked pretty; &#147;I am
already engaged&mdash;&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;To Jokoin,&#148; interposed Harunaga; &#147;I have the
mikado&#146;s permission.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">A storm of applause followed upon the one side,
occasioning as violent denunciation from the other.
No one except the shogun had for a long time so
much as thought of profaning the precincts of celestial
Kyoto, let alone essaying to voice a message thus
sacredly emanating.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Who is this Harunaga?&#148; demanded Fukushima,
most cruel and savage, an old captain of the guard
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page255" id="page255"></a>[pg&nbsp;255]</span>
and relative to Oyea, but not averse to Christian tolerance.
&#147;What right has he to put words into the mouth
of a taiko&#146;s son?&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">Kuroda, still older, and more devoted to the sympathies
of Yodogima, grumbled accordance.</p>
<p class="indent">Esyo held her tongue; she wanted her daughter&mdash;strange
to believe, except as she knew&mdash;married to
Kyogoku, and deemed it best not to interfere.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Oh, I guess, you are not so much, Mr. Fukushima;
we have Sanada, Goto, and a few more equally as
reliable; if you want to rebel, I think we shall be able
to make out; what say you, Esyo?&#148; put in Jokoin,
boastfully.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;I give my daughter to Kyogoku.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;What? He is married,&#148; threatened Kitagira, nervously.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;He can divorce me,&#148; replied Jokoin, concernedly.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Without authority?&#148; inquired Kyogoku, gasping
at some vain law instead of a better wit.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;I have it, and shall use it,&#148; declared Hideyori.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;You have not been appointed, are not an official,&#148;
reasoned Fukushima.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Yes, he has; he is nai-dai-jin; Ieyasu just now
told me so, and I am sure an Interior Great Minister
can do anything he likes,&#148; threatened Jokoin, more
confident than discreet.</p>
<p class="indent">They all ran about with glee, those of the Christians
present; that one so near conversion, as Hideyori, had
been raised to some exalted position were enough to
enthuse them; but Yodogima meditated; the confusion
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page256" id="page256"></a>[pg&nbsp;256]</span>
thereat had left her as doubtful as Ieyasu
had been perplexed with Jokoin&#146;s entanglement. Yet
she would not restrain Hideyori in his exultation from
irretrievably committing himself by exercising only
once the authority; she wanted to accommodate her
sisters, especially Esyo, and perhaps Jokoin&mdash;possibly
herself&mdash;so the power was invoked.</p>
<p class="indent">Ieyasu laughed when informed of the circumstance,
and sending for Jokoin, told her that now he
should encounter little discouragement in winning her
over.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;I want you to be my wife, Jokoin,&#148; said he, without
a wrinkle or a quaver; &#147;you are the last of the
family, and are single again; what say you to feasting
Hideyori: don&#146;t you think he might be gotten rid of in
some such way?&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">Jokoin&#146;s eyes opened wide. The sister to Yodogima
had never heard that one&#146;s former lover talk in that
way before. It seemed impossible that the great Ieyasu,
an unsuspected character, if self-inflicted shogun,
a lifelong aspirant to her sister&#146;s hand, should so belittle
himself as to banter respect however much else.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;I shall speak with Yodogima; you overwhelm me,&#148;
replied Jokoin, dumfounded at her own sensibility.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Please do; tell her that I wish to marry you; that
I would spread a befitting feast; that I beseech a fool
to attend; that Hideyori may judge of what he has
missed; that your extravagance would swamp a
younger man&mdash;all this, and more: say that Esyo, her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page257" id="page257"></a>[pg&nbsp;257]</span>
sister, wants to kill Hideyori, and that I know of no
better means of encompassing that event.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">Jokoin hurried away, fully determined never to return;
the ghost of Hideyori already betokened a reality
at every turn in the road, and from the moorland hard
by arose the whisperings and the wailings of a repentant
sister&mdash;Esyo&#146;s voice rang ominously in her ears.</p>
<p class="indent">Yodogima, contrary to expectations, brightened at
the thought of sending Hideyori into the enemy&#146;s
camp. He had shown himself the man to foil Ieyasu&#146;s
contemplated espionage at its inception: what
greater capacity might be discovered if brought face
to face with a man whose extremity had induced so
flagrant a mouthing.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Tell Ieyasu that Hideyori shall attend with pleasure,
not his marriage revel, but more the witless unmaking
of as pampered a braggadocio as an humbler
memory of Hideyoshi and Nobunaga combined might
have fairly conduced. Tell him that he would eat the
rice-cake these two worthies made; but in the doing
he shall choke for lack of throat. Let him know that
Yodogima lives, and so long as there is a Taira alive
justice shall be done: no man&#146;s religion is to be the
occasion of his persecution, my sisters may do as their
God tells them to do, and Hideyori must reign.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;I couldn&#146;t remember to say all that, at once, and I
had rather remain here,&#148; sighed Jokoin, her great
opened-up eyes dancing at the prospect.</p>
<p class="indent">Sitting there unconscious of another obligation,
Yodogima considered also her resources. Though remembering
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page258" id="page258"></a>[pg&nbsp;258]</span>
well the countenance of Kuroda, and Fukushima&#146;s
measured words, on that memorable morning,
she could but believe them true to their trust.
To her way of thinking, no more probable course had
conformed to an aim attainable; the life she lived
breathed, at every stride, of action, inviolable; their
traditions known so well, Buddha&#146;s precepts, and
Christ&#146;s faith all cried in her ears, &#147;do,&#148; &#147;do,&#148; &#147;do&#148;;
a constant struggle had made her what she was&mdash;the
face of Shin Hachiman (statue of Hideyoshi, the
new War God) looked down from its pedestal at
Kyoto, imploring her to stay the hand of Ieyasu:
how becomingly could a faithful wife, and a mother,
have concluded otherwise?</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Then Hideyori may pronounce it, at the banquet
table; he is my son, and the worthy mouthpiece of a
nobler purpose than feasting.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page259" id="page259"></a>[pg&nbsp;259]</span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIX</h2>

<p class="indent">They had gathered in sumptuous splendor, round
the laden trays, with Ieyasu in place and
Hideyori at his left, as became an honored guest.
Kitagira was there, too; he had been discovered hiding
at Ibaraki, and in consideration of Hideyori&#146;s presence
was allowed or compelled to witness the shogun&#146;s
placing of his own valuation.</p>
<p class="indent">With being told that Hideyori had not the intelligence
to cope with Hidetada, and deciding that only
Yodogima stood between himself and ultimate supremacy,
Ieyasu estimated carefully the former, and
planned the necessity of immediate action against the
latter.</p>
<p class="indent">He had grown old in the harness, would thence
witness a widening of the channel: the prop that he
had visioned must inure to the swift, for Hideyori
justified a mother&#146;s confidence.</p>
<p class="indent">The lotus studding the ponds below lagged lazily in
the breeze that fanned them off the coast at Ozaka.
Softened evidences of his good taste toned and inspired
every nook and cranny of those immaculate halls and
safely trodden grounds, but steel had marked each turn
toward their advance. Must steel again assert superiority?
Would he die fighting? Why should man
at first despise, then relish, the olive? In his younger
days Ieyasu, too, had balked at culture, but with ripened
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page260" id="page260"></a>[pg&nbsp;260]</span>
years it had become a slogan, compelling, all-forceful,
and inevitable.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;I&#146;ll crush him, untutored man, vain infant, inspired
mongrel; endowed with better wit than I, he lacks only
the wisdom&mdash;but his mother! Oh, well; she might
as well be Christian, and dangle her bells at church;
the taiko&#146;s jingle shall be split, and men can very well
spare their better halves, in the pursuit of a less
obstreperous divertisement&mdash;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Hideyori, my lad, what do you think of women?&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;They are the pendulum in a clock.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Pouff! I&#146;ll make cogs and spindles of them. Kitagira,
show this young man thence he came, and send
Hidetada hither; I am satisfied; either of you have
more brains than pluck; the sword is master, and not
a balancer. Hence; and let me strike while the
blood yet runs hot; I have neither time to wait nor
patience to woo a goddess that isn&#146;t mine; Ozaka must
fall.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;I thank you for the entertainment, also for losing
your head, horonable host,&#148; vouchsafed Hideyori, in
parting; &#147;the former, because it is meet to respect
gray hairs: the latter, that honest men may make due
defense. You need not spare Kitagira, or his kind,
for escort; a newer generation makes it possible for
me to leave here, not as you once entered there&mdash;in
a woman&#146;s palanquin&mdash;but as the defender of my
own fortune, and the builder of a nation&#146;s hope&mdash;both
the usefulness and the sacredness of mothers: no less
their motherhood.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page261" id="page261"></a>[pg&nbsp;261]</span>
Hideyori withdrew, the more a man, if such had
been his failing. His elder at arms and with diplomacy,
had thrown to the winds all the finer notions that the
younger had been taught about man&#146;s province and
woman&#146;s part. Look as he would into the fading
realities of a living yesterday, adjure from scenes
imagined against the dawning to-morrow as he did,
the one thought that man is a free agent and beholding
only to the God that lives within drove him toward
his destiny like the thundering waters of a mighty
gorge leap and laugh their way to the calm and peace
always lying somewhere in the untimed, but certain
beyond. And as he tramped along, looking to the right
and to the left, there appeared myriads of living atoms
answering to the same call that so eagerly gladdened
his step, and when the sun burst through, upon these,
their faces turned heavenward&mdash;only the dead and
unborn failed a natural appeal, Amaterasu had written
Ieyasu down, and the younger man hastened to accept
the responsibility.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Woman a slave to man, men the creature of state,
and the state no better than a mechanism? Hearken
not the vulture, but to arms: Christ died upon the
cross; let these hills and valleys grow green in the
blood of Hideyori; a mother&#146;s will and not a father&#146;s
way is the final test of a beginningless God.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">Harunaga had taught him better than Yodogima
believed; there lay behind his spirit an abiding distaste
for anything and everything smacking of unearned
felicity; the getting of something by sufferance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page262" id="page262"></a>[pg&nbsp;262]</span>
were a crime; profit at the expense of some other
man&#146;s effort betokened inanity; the trading of wares
or of benefits lay beneath him; commercialism was
robbery, and diplomacy worse; deception belonged to
the devil, and God had always won, must always win.</p>
<p class="indent">The bribe, therefore, offered to him, by Ieyasu,
the master fibber, the safe, sane, and sound merchant
of goods and other things, had no effect upon the
high-born, reenergized, and rightly tutored Hideyori.
The sop thrown out by the one to the other, of accepting
new territories in exchange for real manhood&mdash;as
in the case of Ieyasu, of Hideyoshi, thence past&mdash;fell
upon deaf ears; as had the attempt to seduce Yodogima,
his mother, with privileges of building temples,
casting bells, and otherwise demeaning herself according
to the predetermined notions of the man who would
use her for a plaything.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;I cannot express my love for you,&#148; promised she,
to her idol, upon his return and the departure of
their two hostages, held as a guarantee; &#147;you convince
me that there is something better in man than
the greed of instinct. Possession is the ultimate goal,
but of the heart and not the belly&mdash;hence harakiri is
a virtue and no man would despoil the fountain-head.
But, my son, have you considered well the means?&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Yes, mother&mdash;truth is invincible.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Yet it, like all nature, is subject to hindrances; the
waters tumbling down their natural courses are oft-times
retarded with log-jams, the banks break, and the
producing land is flooded.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page263" id="page263"></a>[pg&nbsp;263]</span>
&#147;Only for the inevitable good of their enforced
fertilization.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Are you sure that we, in our day, do not confront
the immediate necessity of such replenishment? Are
the rice-fields abundant, the dikes strong, and the
waters free?&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Let me answer with a question: if the fields are
hungry, will denial, deception, or putting off, stay the
hand of reckoning? Is it making history to shoulder
posterity with the evil of to-day&#146;s cowardice? Is it
manly? Is it godlike? If so, then we, too, can makeshift
honorably. If not, I would crush the hydra-headed
monster in his den. Let him not, through our
stupidity, carelessness, or cursedness, fasten his tentacles
upon the unborn&mdash;most compelling of God&#146;s
previsioning&mdash;sons and daughters in whom alone we
shall survive hell and attain heaven.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">Yodogima bowed in her son&#146;s presence; she could
not speak for the pride arising out of a greater sentiment;
words would have voiced the colder side of
life; attributes only of the soul moved her to make
some recognition of this fancied, hoped-for, and willed
higher reach. All the felicities of a life earnestly lived
seemed answered in that one likened expression.
Then why should he have burdened her with further
obligation? What lacked she yet of the great circle
that encompasses creation?</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Do not bow, my mother,&#148; requested he, his voice
modulated as if to penetrate deeper than heart; &#147;it
is I who should kneel; maternity is the keynote of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page264" id="page264"></a>[pg&nbsp;264]</span>
existence, and when it has thought to command, and
not obey, men shall have reached indeed the threshold
of greatness. Arise, that I may do what in the
future men shall learn of necessity.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Must I, too, do service?&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Yes; it is ordained of equality.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Then I&#146;ll do it, and see you, each, that his spear
is in order, for the battle shall be to the quick.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">Before Hideyori could at all respond; Jokoin
snatched up the bugle, and running to the rampart&#146;s
edge, blew a blast that brought the loyal speeding;
no live man would fail a summons as vital: the one
call that has lifted antiquity&#146;s veil, makes the day
worth its enduring, and rouses better expectations of
the future: Sanada shouted:</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Let me fight; the princess foresees, and progression
is her right,&#148; and Goto, Ono, the young and the
vigorous, those patriots and their martyrs, Christian
or Pagan, rallied to the defense of liberty.</p>
<p class="indent">Only Kuroda, Fukushima, and the hirelings of
content, their kind, refused accession to Yodogima&#146;s
stand.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;When you are as old as we, the wells of enthusiasm
shall have dried,&#148; whined they, walking out at the
gate&mdash;thrown open by Kyogoku, the instrument of
Esyo&mdash;regretting only that their convenience and
Yodogima&#146;s indiscretion made it more delectable for
them to break an uncrossed faith than perform a
sworn duty.</p>
<p class="indent">They walked out, and others came in, in legion.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page265" id="page265"></a>[pg&nbsp;265]</span>
The Christians responded, to a man, and no such
stalwart soldiery had before gathered&mdash;in any cause.
The edict against these Christians, on the one hand, and
the attempt upon Hideyori, on the other, had brought
to Yodogima&#146;s support a force and a promise that
jarred for once the understanding of Ieyasu. Policy
had been his stronghold, from the first; the one battle
risked and fought, at Sekigahara, had been forced and
won at the instance of Yodogima, and the reaper of its
booty knew it, had extended his hand as recompense,
and in the frenzy of madness brought about an unthought
catastrophe, seemingly as needless as
destructive.</p>
<p class="indent">Only the pinched of face and sycophant at heart
surrounded him now; men waxing corpulent, and
others anxious to coddle them; the philosopher because
he could afford to be one; possessors of endowed
chairs at colleges, the gifts of one another;
builders of libraries, in the hope of perpetuating
doubtful memories; merchant princes, and financial
jugglers, these and their like, who lap for favors,
jostled each other in the crying of peace&mdash;that their
interests might not be disturbed.</p>
<p class="indent">Ieyasu looked them over.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;And this is what Hideyoshi&#146;s democracy really
developed! A war, and all the men at the enemy&#146;s
beck and call. Had I Yodogima&#146;s strength I&#146;d close
these doors&mdash;but I can; I&#146;ll make the barons defend
their own vested interests. Diplomacy shall yet avail
the state,&#148; resolved he, cold and set.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page266" id="page266"></a>[pg&nbsp;266]</span>
&#147;Esyo?&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;What is it,&#148; demanded she.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Tell Yodogima that Ieyasu would like to call, in
conference, at her pleasure. Will you do me the
kindness?&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Yes, honorable father-in-law. When, please?&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Forthwith, my good Esyo.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">Esyo went, but delivered instead an ultimatum.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;I came to thank you for the loan of Kyogoku,
Yodogima,&#148; said she, artfully.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;But he played me a trick?&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Did you expect more?&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;No; not of him; but of you.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;And you shall not be disappointed; you may keep
the infant; women are cheap, and shoguns dear&mdash;do
you observe the pattern, of my gown, Yodogima? I
trust I wear it, becomingly, you perceive?&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Yes, Esyo; I understand, now. It has taken me a
long time to believe a sister could play another false&mdash;you
have my protection beyond the lines, and my
best wishes always: tell your father-in-law that I
accept his challenge, and that war alone can determine
the issue.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">Esyo could not await her own return, so couriers
were advanced with the intelligence. Upon her
arrival, much excitement but little enthusiasm lingered
at Fushima. Kuroda, Fukushima, and others
of the daimyos were there in council with Ieyasu&mdash;the
new shogun, Hidetada, had already prepared to
march.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page267" id="page267"></a>[pg&nbsp;267]</span>
&#147;It is your fault, Kuroda, and Fukushima, and you
my spineless schemers, that hostilities have begun,
and&mdash;&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Cannot their leaders be bought?&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;You shall have to fight, or surrender to the Christians;
Yodogima is not purchasable.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">Levies were hastened forward, and the treasures
brought in; Ieyasu had succeeded, and greed for
once stood compelled to surrender its power unto
determined men, or subject themselves to the leadership
of a man who hated no less the influence of
plethoric wealth upon state than dreaded the consequences
of a partial democracy among men. The
Christians had become the instrument; and diplomacy
proved the means with which Ieyasu divided the
nation and equipped himself to enforce centralization.</p>
<p class="indent">Yodogima had builded upon broader lines: her star
seemed the brighter.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXX</h2>

<p class="indent">War had been declared, the decisive battle faced
them, and neither side underestimated the
other&#146;s strength nor neglected his own best possible
recourse. Yodogima and Ieyasu, two lovers
at heart, loomed the more formidable as enemies,
measuring each other in the luminous cauldron of a
perfect understanding, and did not their souls unite in
the attainment of a common, supreme, an overwhelming
obligation&mdash;the means as widely divergent as the
uplift had been ideal&mdash;courage had failed either, and
humanity must have lost a most ardently conceived, if
untimely wrought, exemplification.</p>
<p class="indent">At her left, the sun rose clear and commanding,
behind the hills of Nara, where the sages had lived
and died unto the days of myth, perhaps when Jimmu
landed a wanderer from burdens escaped, or as descended
of the gods in heaven. Memories of these
things inspired Yodogima. The sacredness of its soil
compelled thoughts farther away than of to-day.</p>
<p class="indent">A thousand temples commemorated events that
would not yield to the onrush of ambition or the more
potent realities of an every-day humdrum; bonzes
gray and firm chanted music both sacred and dear
behind those walls scattered here and there throughout
the rugged fastness to and beyond this Nara, the
seat of the best that God, in his fairness, had inspired;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page269" id="page269"></a>[pg&nbsp;269]</span>
birds soared statelier here, the odor of flowers smelled
more authentic, and the stones stubborn puzzled their
reading; no man ventured into these hallowed mysteries
without a deeper sense of the responsibilities
that fade and shadow as we trudge or falter the stepping
liege of escaping time, and out of its depths there
arose a force as restraining.</p>
<p class="indent">Over to the westward, the passions and the penalties
crowded hard and fast those of realistic now; not a
man of them spared the energy of a thought or wended
the loss of a step toward that past and gone, or measured
in other than dollars and cents the future and
its dependence, as against an always tardy, yet fast-running
present; shop or hovel, land and water, man
or beast, the cultured and the uncultured, jammed
and fretted in one continuous roar commercial. What
compensations, for such turmoil! A million souls
dwarfed into no higher recompense than thirst to
own, hunger to appease, and only death to relieve it
all. No glad messages trumpeted their tired and aimless
steps, serving or served, the plethoric rich and
the indigent poor, the hopeful or the despairing alike
groped, ran, or loafed their allotted space in its empty,
beggarly passing.</p>
<p class="indent">Yodogima prayed for these; they lay sadly beyond
any more helpful, if grateful, equivalent.</p>
<p class="indent">But to the front, looking southward, broad vistas
of undulated expanse led on, over the rice fields and
into areas bordered with the blue of ocean&#146;s tireless,
unpolluted energies. At her back reared mighty walls
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page270" id="page270"></a>[pg&nbsp;270]</span>
and sank deeper the moats&mdash;no intruder might strike
there; but here, in the foreground, upon unsullied soil,
underneath her own surveillance, in the very bosom
of their stronghold, the battle must be fought.</p>
<p class="indent">The hosts were already gathering: Sanada led them;
he had tasted of the blood sacrificial; fought his way
to Uyeda, in the teeth of Hideyasu&#146;s avenging; his
father gave him the choice, of following Ieyasu or
donning the new: in him, young and active, there had
risen fresher desires, fervid, if inconsiderate.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Let us fight,&#148; he had said, replying to Jokoin&#146;s
trumpeting, and in view of these energies had been
given command, under Hideyori, the chief, counselled
by Harunaga, more matured than either, directed
by Yodogima, their princess&mdash;trusted, if not worshipped.</p>
<p class="indent">Were she then, to them, Christian or Pagan, as
much as goddess; or should the future, yet, reveal
some deeper hidden truth?</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;It is good to behold confidences as liberally bestowed,&#148;
vowed Yodogima, to Jokoin, who came up
to share, in her way, the picture unfolding, &#147;albeit,
the responsibility; Hideyori can well acquit himself,
but these Christians&mdash;so wrought in faith, hopeful,
and charitable: withal unknowing, helpless, and confiding.
I must not lose this contest; they are no match
for the colder ethics of Orientalism: yet were not
placed here to go down martyrs, or to eke out materialistically&mdash;their
religion is not at fault so much, as it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page271" id="page271"></a>[pg&nbsp;271]</span>
is inadequate, undeveloped, short of finality. The
circle is incomplete.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Nor shall we fail, though defeated,&#148; chimed in the
good sister; there are more ways than one, to skin a
cat, and we&#146;ll dodge, as sure as whipped. You can
bet on Christ, every time; he&#146;s a winner, and the world
has just got to kowtow.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;What makes you talk that way, Jokoin? One
would think the Old Nick himself had the better hold&mdash;and
I am sure you were not as you are till something
made you so: was it Christianity?&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;How do I know? I just feel that way, and what&#146;s
the use of bothering? Why ask? Just go in, to win;
that&#146;s the game, to lose&mdash;well, I won&#146;t say what it&#146;s
like, but the name spells horrors!&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;And if I should fail?&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;You can&#146;t&mdash;not as long as I am left; I&#146;d eat fire,
for you; that is my religion.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Thank you, sister; but&mdash;well, I was going to say,
that that sounds more like the Taira. I wonder if the
Coming could have had any connection&mdash;do you see
those plains, Jokoin? There is a hill, near the center:
is there a Cross there; I cannot quite make out: your
Vision may be stronger than mine?&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;I couldn&#146;t see half so far; besides, I&#146;d miss the
fun of going, if I did; there&#146;s somebody there, now;
it&#146;s Hideyori; I&#146;m off; so long.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">Yodogima, however serious or busied, could not
resist the infection, and with Jokoin&#146;s bounding down
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page272" id="page272"></a>[pg&nbsp;272]</span>
the slope for the time being lost control, as it were,
of herself.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;What buoyancy,&#148; mused she; &#147;if the world could
imbibe the half of hers, there wouldn&#146;t be anything
but mock&mdash;yes, make-believe&mdash;fighting done. And
then&mdash;oh; it is too absurd; man is not a laughing
stock. Nero may have grimaced his way into Rome,
but its hills shall drench still yet with the tears he
shed.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">And back at Fushima, far removed from Ozaka,
and its elemental forces, at work upon plans and defences,
as indefatigable as laudable, a more conscienceless,
less movable coterie of individuals, the shapening
parts to a masterful piece of mechanism, their
features wan and purses opened, the whip-lash laid
or tackles baited&mdash;these, barons by profession and
soldiers of compulsion, haters in fact, yet supporters
for safety&mdash;they, under extremes, busied their bodies
with replenishing the commissary and recruiting the
ranks of an army as different in character as it were
essential to habit.</p>
<p class="indent">No thought of daringness conserved the interests of
these shouters for peace, at any price save its legitimate
cost. Every reformer in their eyes became at
once a disturber; patriotism were charlatanism, and
the knowing ones cried down as demagogues; they
shouted plenty and practiced penuriousness, gorged
themselves and bade others be satisfied with the crumbs&mdash;or
their lot.</p>
<p class="indent">Such were the motley hordes gathered to render
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page273" id="page273"></a>[pg&nbsp;273]</span>
Ieyasu master&mdash;and he had learned a lesson, knew
the kind of discipline these fellows relished, and gave
them their due&mdash;hunger. To feed, then, or to keep,
as well, these hirelings, or their hirers, drilled and
coddled, marched or trudged upon Ozaka.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Poor humans; I pity you,&#148; sighed Yodogima; Ieyasu
dragged after, as uncertain as dogged.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXI</h2>

<p class="indent">Long lines of coerced, machine-made, and let-live
mortals wended the broadening valleys leading
from the seat of empire, Kyoto&#146;s mouldering gate,
Fushima, toward the walled-in adjuster, Ozaka, under
whose shelter there throbbed in every archer and each
spearman the impulse that leads to liberty.</p>
<p class="indent">A mighty task confronted these invaders, the mercenary
half of a nation. Obedience to an over-mastery
had become their watchword; through long ages the
spark that enlightens had been drubbed and coaled
into nothing more than the droll leaden heat of an
improvident toll, and the hills on either side echoed
from one to the other only such monotonous rhythm
as dulled or tinkled in the ears of baser content or
lulled to sleep any instinct born of more than earth&#146;s
paid transient competence.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Law and order is the order and the law,&#148; growled
Ieyasu, as the last one of those corpulent commanders
eased back upon the tired, stooped shoulders bearing
him hence&mdash;to what and where only the lost and fading
records of regardful time could or would flaunt
in the faces of a blushing posterity.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Are the spears sharp,&#148; demanded he, when the
train had as diligently ranked apace.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;I&#146;ll inquire, sir,&#148; responded the orderly, thinking
only of the wage he had contracted&mdash;and the echo
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page275" id="page275"></a>[pg&nbsp;275]</span>
answering back, from the farthest spoke in the wheel,
sounded like:</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;All&#146;s well, sir.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Avast! I warrant,&#148; muttered Ieyasu, &#147;not one of
them knows the meaning, however prodded or ribbed.
A heartless task, this; and, I do believe the soul cries&mdash;but
to the work:</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Forward, march!&#148; and the drive began; the machine
creaked; the master builder, however, oiled
methodically its thirsty bearings and adjusted as
economically the squeaking parts.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;It&#146;s a time-keeper, if ugly,&#148; muttered he, as the
trodden ground, too, responded with agony to the listless
demands of an overly candid, if seldom understood,
&#147;tramp, tramp, tramp&#148;&mdash;and the knowing few,
constant criers of, &#147;hands off, hands off, hands off,&#148;
paled at the prospect of their own befouling&mdash;Christ&#146;s
blood bore no relation to the parboiling blue of their
ensemble; Pontius had exemplified the wiser conduct.</p>
<p class="indent">Anxious hearts and eager eyes, over there, on the
other side, amid the burnings and yearnings of betterment,
atop privilege and opposed to lying, their honor
at stake and a lighted beacon in the hand, singing
songs of gladness and shouting defiance at sin, a mission
to perform and life ahead&mdash;these were the men
and women who manned the ship whose supercargo
responds only to healthful dictation and whose decks
are freighted with the fragrant odor of valorous
deeds.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Let the work be quickly done,&#148; advised Yodogima,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page276" id="page276"></a>[pg&nbsp;276]</span>
high at the helm&#146;s guidance, aloft the citadel of manlier
entente. &#147;Strike the vibrating thing at its weakest
point, and when these carping conservatives shall
have once scented the cost of healthier action their
flagrant confidence must fall of its own overweight.
The very thought is shocking, but truth is most
obvious: the only way to rid a body is to gouge an evil
growth. Your hearts are strong; see that you strike
deep, and nobly.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">Not a man faltered, no one questioned his rations;
the prize savored of freedom, the penalties were of
trifling consideration, and these men deployed their
forces with a vim and an assurance that sounded afar
the masked countenance of those they defied.</p>
<p class="indent">Kuroda and Fukushima hearkened, sickening at
their own stupid estimate. The two of them, lifelong
servers of a better fortune, respected supporters of
Hideyoshi, had sworn, sealing the oath with their own
blood, to defend and uphold the cause that Hideyori,
an infant, had inherited and Yodogima, his mother,
now sought with fearless energy to conserve, that
Hideyoshi, the builder, had inaugurated, and that Nobunaga,
a beginner, had conceived. A terrible retribution
bore down hard, as their foolish mistake and her
upright stand fairly began to dawn. Committed and
hemmed in, there seemed no escape&mdash;Ieyasu solved
the problem.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Banished,&#148; snarled he, to Hidetada, his chief counsellor,
and in the presence of other barons assembled
for that purpose; &#147;and that their example may prove
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page277" id="page277"></a>[pg&nbsp;277]</span>
salutary, in the case of any like minded or weak kneed,
it is my instruction that you kill these upon the slightest
show of rebellion. To Yedo with them, and dagger
athwart.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">Only Maeda, the younger, responded; he had witnessed
the dispatch of his father, sometime guardian
over Hideyori, and jumping to his feet, vowed undying
fidelity to Ieyasu; he knew the forced intriguer&#146;s
methods, perhaps divined some advantage in his tactics,
for he had inherited untouched his father&#146;s
estates, if not a better security&mdash;Ieyasu then made
him head commander, under Hidetada, his chief, subject
only to himself as dictator, obeyed, if despised.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Then it is Maeda that Ieyasu, a wooer, would
pit against my Sanada, a patriot?&#148; replied Yodogima,
when advised of the circumstance&mdash;no doings on
either side escaped her; Kyogoku, now, again, for the
one, and Honda, Ieyasu&#146;s secretary, with the other,
proved good intelligencers, if shaky, or resolute, otherwise.
&#147;Perhaps he, Maeda, too, will have changed
somewhat when he has unexpectedly discovered that
smoking powder, and not farmers&#146; arrows, await him.
Sanada may sleep at the gate, but Maeda shall never
cross these walls&mdash;no doubt there are others in Ieyasu&#146;s
train of the same mind as Kuroda and Fukushima:
we shall see, well before the wise Ieyasu
has bought or defeated a man of mine; freedom and
failure are antithetical in fact.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">Ridding his camp of the last, as he believed, who
dared shake at the knees, and shouldering the remaining
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page278" id="page278"></a>[pg&nbsp;278]</span>
daimyos with the brunt of fighting and danger,
keeping his own immediate levies, the Tokugawas, in
reserve at the rear, where neither spear or arrow nor
powder and shot could do them harm, Ieyasu gave
out the orders:</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Form a semicircle, the rest of you, my doubtful
daimyos&mdash;I shall test your backbones; single-handed,
and with no shelter available, you shall fight or turn
traitor; Yodogima&#146;s methods and mood are well known&mdash;from
Settsu to Idzumi, surrounding from shore to
shore the enemy&#146;s grounds: they will hardly take to
the water; there are no ships available: Maeda shall
lead well round the Yamato (Nara) hills and approaching
Ozaka from the south, with Hidetada at
his rear and myself close after, strike them at their
strongest point. The arm is strong, we have two
to their one, and every hot-head fallen is an abiding
guarantee of peace. It is a shame that these beautiful
engines of war should needs be put to use, but&mdash;well,
I have exhausted every recourse to bring Hideyori to
my way of thinking: he is foolishly ambitious, wickedly
rooted, and must be removed.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">Two hundred thousand of them thus moved upon
Yodogima, the mother, perhaps responsible for some
of Hideyori&#146;s real traits, however misjudging or particular
Ieyasu had taken it upon himself to be. Nor
had she been less pronounced in her convictions.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Remove the cause for all this war paraphernalia,
and the effect shall be at once to relieve humanity of
its needless building: the very best way to do that is to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page279" id="page279"></a>[pg&nbsp;279]</span>
use well what we have got&mdash;here and elsewhere, now,
before our resources shall have been exhausted with
trying to bluff each other,&#148; she had said to Ieyasu.
repeatedly, upon his showing the white feather, to
Hideyoshi, his earliest rival.</p>
<p class="indent">They came on, these derelicts, of duty, their banners
waving and mouths sustaining, the advancing
heavy-weights skirting the mountains to the eastward,
with the singly doled daimyos holding down their
respective posts as assigned. Yodogima surveyed the
situation, as she could, from her central position. The
semicircle occasioned no uneasiness; as she surmised&mdash;Ieyasu
had overlooked it&mdash;every one of them
considered his place a most advantageous roost from
which to observe results in front, sliding down on
either side as convenience should dictate.</p>
<p class="indent">They did serve their would-be master, however, in
quite another respect: their absence relieved Ieyasu
of the necessity of lumbering more than Maeda&#146;s contingent
around those hills and over the plains, where
bubbled the waters and grew the seed Yodogima had
sprung or sown in lavish abundance. Patriots were
budding like cherries in springtime, and a driven
march but made the fragrance smell the sweeter.</p>
<p class="indent">Now, Maeda swung into the open, a formidable
army loomed to the southward, and Yodogima breathed
easier; her estimate thus far had proven correct; the
attack would come as expected; Ieyasu had employed
the only tactics he knew&mdash;Sanada apparently slept at
the nearest gate.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page280" id="page280"></a>[pg&nbsp;280]</span>
Directly across the intended battlefield, well in
advance of the outer moat, running from the water
front on the right to the river Nekogawa at her left, a
low embankment, some ten feet in height, had been
unexpectedly thrown up and faced of rock, with a
deep water-trap hugging the farthest side, from end
to end.</p>
<p class="indent">The invaders mistook this to be the outer moat:
the patriots lay low, behind Sanada; who, to their
astonishment, only snored.</p>
<p class="indent">Then, Hidetada wheeled his van, the flower of Yedo,
well onto the plain; they were loyal men, but as yet
in the measurement, as to their fullest capacity; the
commander-in-chief had recruited of the newer Tokugawa,
and any sudden charge might be expected to
stampede the whole, in case of Maeda&#146;s rout, in advance&mdash;Harunaga,
mobilized just inside the last regular
moat, at the right-hand gate, awaiting only a
chance.</p>
<p class="indent">Yodogima had not as much confidence in his boldness,
as respect for his courage; their strategy, like
the enemy&#146;s valor, must abide younger heads or hearts
than those of Harunaga and Ieyasu.</p>
<p class="indent">Lastly, Ieyasu showed his face, and the veterans
of his experience, samurai tried and found true, on
many a scarred and fought-to-the-finish contest, their
steps more studied and ears better cocked, these trusties
ranked in, on the farthest side of the broad open,
still beyond, in the rear. This, then, were the division
that Hideyori, young and untried, should meet, if
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page281" id="page281"></a>[pg&nbsp;281]</span>
needs be, in a final determination of their destinies:
the decisive conflict of an age.</p>
<p class="indent">Hideyori at the beginning: Ieyasu at the end of a
career.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;It is blood against experience, and who would
change it?&#148; half whispered, half shouted Yodogima, a
mother, as she swept the horizon with those eyes that
had never failed her, looked into the faces which had
gathered, and drilled, and armed, in behalf of manliness.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;My dear men,&#148; said she, turning to them, from
her seat above, &#147;you cannot fail. Whatever may become
of me, however I or mine may demean himself,
manhood is the secret buried underneath or revealed
of any and every godlike doctrine, thought, or action.
It is Godly, and the trend of the devil is toward the
flesh. A strong heart knows its haven: a weak one
abides the fires that consume. Manhood has made this
world what it is, perhaps soared here, to this, from
planets above; is making the world of to-day, however
prosperous lying may seem; shall continue to
make it, till there remains no need of a hell&mdash;thus and
then, only, may heaven be attained. On with the work,
and let no guilty thing escape!&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">Ieyasu, too, had spoken; climbing to a hill-top,
Chausu, close at hand, on the right, the would-be besieger
levelled his glasses, scanning the field before
him. His own division of some sixty thousand samurai
occupied the open lying between the hill on which
he stood and the sea to the left; on the extreme
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page282" id="page282"></a>[pg&nbsp;282]</span>
opposite side of the field to his right stood Hidetada
and his army of equal size, extending on toward the
eastward, till the hill Okayama, rearing up as a sentinel,
shut out all intervening space between his forces
and the river Hirano: the top of which hill afforded
also the commander-in-chief, Hidetada, a most excellent
vantage point.</p>
<p class="indent">At the extreme front, toward the center, lay Maeda,
with his perhaps forty thousand Kaga bloods, including
their allies, ready to do when bid. To his, Maeda&#146;s,
right and to his left, spanning the distance from Hirano
river, the eastern field border, to the sea at the
west, stretched, together with his own&mdash;an intended
battering ram&mdash;minor forces of the doubtful daimyos
who had been placed to form the famed semicircle, as
well as such others as had been brought up to strengthen
the contemplated charge. Still in front of all, near
by, lay the small hill Sasayama, coveted by Maeda, but
held as an outpost by Sanada&mdash;apparently sleeping,
farther on, at the gate post.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;We have the foe, safe enough, in front of us: our
rear is free from molestation,&#148; chuckled Ieyasu, to
Hidetada, his son, who had come over, in the evening,
to consult about the proposed early morning attack.
&#147;With the enemy before them and the Tokugawa
behind, what chance have these dilatory daimyos of
ours? Why, they&#146;ll be chowdered before the sun is
risen.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Then Hidetada shall pounce upon the foe with the
freshness of morning,&#148; replied he, elated, if over-anxious,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page283" id="page283"></a>[pg&nbsp;283]</span>
&#147;and before the dew is fairly dried they shall
have gone, to their happy hunting-ground.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Well said, my son,&#148; ejaculated the forgetful hero
of Sekigahara, &#147;and Ieyasu shall dine in Ozaka.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Alone, father?&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Why do you ask; have I ever denied you, my
boy?&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Oh; I had another thought in mind.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;It had been better, were it a view.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;I don&#146;t just like, so very much, fighting in the dark;
but, as it may take the enemy some time to obliterate
Maeda&mdash;and the rest of them, the sneaking daimyos&#146;
lines&mdash;I may not have to expose myself, till daylight,
at best,&#148; surmised Hidetada, the Taira-wed branch of
the family, descended Minamoto.</p>
<p class="indent">Ieyasu made no answer; he could not, had he
tried; Yodogima rose to mind, and he thought only of
what might have been, had he but taken advantage
of Hideyoshi&#146;s bluffing, long ago, at Fuchu, the elder
Maeda&#146;s once upon a time seat of true chivalry. Esyo
had in fact, as observed, exercised an influence over
her husband: what might not the sister have done, had
she been the mother.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Oh, well; it is too late, now,&#148; muttered the taiko&#146;s
once trusted ally, giving the order, in reality, for an
unrecallable, before-the-day-break assault; then staggering
to the ground, helplessly, under the weight of
his own remorseful thirst, as he did the quenchless
deed. &#147;Stab; yes, stab her, too!&#148;</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page284" id="page284"></a>[pg&nbsp;284]</span>
And Yodogima answered, that final test, as became
a weaker hand, if stronger heart.</p>
<p class="indent">Fog clouds hung low, the darkness grew intense,
and these men could scarcely see their way; dread
uncertainty had laid hold on shrivelled hearts; Maeda&#146;s
advance groped its way round the hill Sasayama;
Maeda and some few others climbed up.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Where is he?&#148; asked they, of one another; &#147;these
grounds seem deserted.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Hark!&#148; ventured someone.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Did you hear that snore?&#148; inquired another.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;It is Sanada; he sleeps; over there; at the outer
castle gate; let us strike him; he is foolish.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">They stumbled forward, in the darkness, and coming
upon a man propped against a stake. Date prodded
him; this daimyo had been doing similar service since
the days of Odawara.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;What are you doing here; do you not know that
we are enemies?&#148; inquired Mori, another of Hideyoshi&#146;s
upon-a-time staunch supporters.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;I wait to see, that we make no mistake; we have
some farmers&#146; arrows to shoot with, but would do
no harm, to a friend.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Hear you,&#148; said they, all alike, one to another, &#147;he
makes sport, in the face of danger; avenge our good
name, Maeda, and let us make short work of the rest.
Did you hear what he said? They &#145;have some farmers&#146;
arrows&#146;&mdash;a pretty weapon to use against such
as we! Spread the word, and we&#146;ll scale those walls
before a soul of them has half finished sleeping.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page285" id="page285"></a>[pg&nbsp;285]</span>
Junkei therefore paid the penalty, without resistance;
he had truly slept his sleep, for it was he and
not Sanada who snored those daimyos to their doom.</p>
<p class="indent">Eighty thousand of their force rushed forward to
scale the walls, and that blind ditch of Yodogima&#146;s
provisioning emptied its waters to make room for the
drowning invaders. Others rushed over these and
against the embankment, where Sanada stood, his
sleepless forces unscathed, to chop and slash them
down. For hours they mired and fought, trapped
and headless&mdash;but to no purpose; every stone&#146;s width
in that wall had its defender, with another and still
others within reach to take his place should chance or
fatigue down and disable him. There was no shouting
of orders; the word had gone round and around
till every man of them knew by heart the role he
should enact. Neither had a shot been fired; the guns
lay loaded, and the powder unburned, behind still
other walls of huger import and loftier building.</p>
<p class="indent">Practically one-third of Ieyasu&#146;s strength&mdash;for
those scared hirelings did fight, when cornered, quite
as stubbornly as the liege master&#146;s aged samurai could
have done&mdash;his most valiant commander, under Hidetada,
Maeda, and nearly all of those doubtful daimyos&mdash;a
few of them yet remained behind Ozaka, still in
the semicircle&mdash;were either killed, routed, or scared
into further uselessness. Nor was this all, for inside
the fortifications a newer confidence sprang to the fore,
impulse beat harder against the dictates of judgment,
and but for Yodogima&#146;s influence alone they had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page286" id="page286"></a>[pg&nbsp;286]</span>
rushed one and all thirstily upon the waiting reserves.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Calm yourselves, my friends,&#148; urged she, confident
in their strength; &#147;if you would follow one victory
with another, then buckle your armor the closer. Madness
means weakness, and you shall yet have enough
to do before Hidetada is worsted; he will not expose
his strength under cover of night; he has had better
training. And there is Ieyasu, behind him; an inverted
pyramid, with both sides blocked by natural
barriers. Mind what I say: Ieyasu planned well,
but his strategy is ancient; no doubt it served in the
days of Confucius, but a new warfare has come; I
command you: do not fire a gun, not a man of you,
till you can count the teeth, each and everybody in his
target&#146;s head.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">They waited; no one would disobey, and only one
so much as sold himself&mdash;Nanjo, a subordinate captain,
for a miserly price ventured to carry Ieyasu&#146;s
fiefly proposals to Sanada; who scorned the proffered
estates, publishing everywhere the traitor&#146;s head as an
example. Here, at last, Ieyasu, the wise, had found
exemplified the truth, to his betterment, that honor and
not gold measures the content of highest living.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;I am doubtful about an open charge,&#148; cautioned
he, of Hidetada, as the cover of night began breaking,
yet far to the eastward.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;I am not,&#148; replied the younger man, more doubtful
about covers, or chicanery, of any kind.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Then you shall have to face them&mdash;I am ill.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;At ease, I trow; and if you think you can bribe a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page287" id="page287"></a>[pg&nbsp;287]</span>
Taira into retirement&mdash;see here, father; you should
have tried first my wife; I think I know her breed; I
am going to fight.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">The clouds rose, and the day opened glad, if not
inspiring. Hidetada bestirred himself with the first
lifting of night, and as the gray fogs banked over
against the gorged-out mountains, with here and there
a village or a temple hung defiantly or standing gracefully
upon some jutting point or sloping greensward,
those more sympathetic, if rawer, recruits, from the
Tokugawa domain, took up the forward advance, and
refacing the broken fragments of Maeda&#146;s demolished
command now at first made that valley resound with
the frenzy of rallying blood-tasted savagery.</p>
<p class="indent">Hidetada led them, and like with him the reward of
valor had justified the risk. Stringing out his long
formation into V shape, his right resting upon the solid
Hirano, the left hard upon the seashore, and a solid
oblong breaking and forming the V&#146;s middle, they
tramped straight ahead, thus in zigzag alignment, toward
a solid defense, from river to sea, behind the
fortifications at Ozaka.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;They mean to break our walls midway, disregarding
altogether the gates, then quarter about and march
each half to the opening thus made,&#148; said Yodogima,
to Hideyori, her readiest counsellor. &#147;I wonder what
means they have to batter down barriers so thick and
high&mdash;a hundred and twenty feet, I presume, just
there.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Let them come,&#148; replied the son. &#147;And if they do
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page288" id="page288"></a>[pg&nbsp;288]</span>
make the breach, I promise you that I and not they
shall be the first to sally through; Harunaga&#146;s guns
are trained, and he is going to count their teeth. Depend
upon it.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">Sanada lay close, under shelter of the low, temporary
embankment: his ranks had been little impaired;
Yodogima remained high up in the citadel&mdash;Hidetada
advanced, to the wall where lay Sanada.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;What kind of hunting do you have out there?
You might find it better on this side the wall,&#148; said
Sanada, to Hidetada.</p>
<p class="indent">Hidetada made no answer, but began hopping his
men over&mdash;the center first, and then others, as they
came up&mdash;charging toward the outer main walls, as
Yodogima had surmised.</p>
<p class="indent">Sanada fell back, coaxing them on.</p>
<p class="indent">They had come well within range of Harunaga&#146;s
matchlocks, the main body facing them squarely, when
suddenly there rang out the unexpected:</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Fire!&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">The enemy fell like rice heads underneath a sickle
bar, and Sanada, wheeling, charged those reeling columns
that Hidetada had marched to no better results
than Maeda&#146;s.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXII</h2>

<p class="indent">Ieyasu groaned under the weight of their defeat;
no one knew better than he the futility of matching
defiance against gun-powder, and Jokoin had forewarned
him, inadvertently let the secret out, yet the
would-be builder of an intended autocracy dared not
delay at all the execution of his plans. One that had
of necessity materialized doggedly, now found him
inconveniently approaching the end of any real assured
activity, then awaiting better, as he knew only too
well, the internal weakening of a democracy engrafted
firmly, if insecurely, by Hideyoshi, in the face of him.</p>
<p class="indent">His own forces, the Tokugawas, upon whom he
could rely, were inadequate to batter down the defenses
round Ozaka, and Yodogima, with the Christians
and their devices safely driven into her camp,
required only the opportunity to win over a dissenting
element; who had already begun to smart, if not
waver, under his very questionably assumed domination.
These he had placed as well as he could in the
teeth of danger, not only to save his own meager
samurai, and Hidetada&#146;s raw recruits, together constituting
the heart and the flower of the Tokugawa,
but to weaken no less, if possible, the besieged. To do
this, a midnight attack proffered an only hope&mdash;he
must not disclose the fact, yet knew of his own knowledge
that a daylight engagement meant disaster. Could
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page290" id="page290"></a>[pg&nbsp;290]</span>
Harunaga have been inveigled into wasting his ammunition
upon darkness, whatever the outcome of Maeda,
and the daimyos, those scarred samurai of his, following
up the fiery youth under Hidetada&#146;s command, had
made quick work of all that should be left at the
castle.</p>
<p class="indent">All these plans, so carefully laid, if inadvertently
executed, had missed the outcome expected; the chagrinned
and defeated master at last lay exhausted
and hopeless; he had threatened harakiri as a last
resort; the bushido should not be violated; Hidetada
alone consoled him; the fragments of his beaten youths
were returning in handfuls; word came in, also, of
Hideyori&#146;s marshaling his untouched reserves and
that the reorganized and fired-up hosts of democracy
might be expected to swoop down upon them at any
moment.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Prepare yourself, Hidetada; there is but one honor
left us.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">Withdrawing tearfully, the obedient son, an enforced
husband and dearly-bought shogun, staggered
to his own deserted quarters; only one remained to
comfort him.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;What now, my lord?&#148; inquired Esyo, gallantly, if
concerned.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Make ready, Esyo; all is done for, save&mdash;&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;What?&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Harakiri.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Not for me, my good husband.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Do you deny me, also this consideration?&#148;</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page291" id="page291"></a>[pg&nbsp;291]</span>
&#147;Yes.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Buddha! May there be one left, then, to avenge
my good name.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;There shall be&mdash;Sakuma, unhand this husband of
mine, albeit he would dishonor not me; I shall have
need for him here, in better grace, if not of reason.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Sakuma! Does the grave yield its own?&#148; whispered
Hidetada.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;You see him&mdash;perhaps a little aged, but in the
flesh and blood. Keep a good watch, Sakuma, lest
the shogun&#146;s honor fail me his boots.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">Hidetada may not have liked the idea of being disarmed,
or disillusioned, but the reasoning of his wife
baffled him. Abstruse and as headstrong she had
raised him from a secondary place in the family to
that of shogun: the very consciousness of that advancement
induced some consideration for if not confidence
in her abilities, though the methods yet seemed
as incomprehensible as the motive hitherto had been
elusive. The shogun therefore suffered the disgrace;
there was no denying Esyo, whether shamefaced or
pleased.</p>
<p class="indent">Nor did she trust alone to promising; once his sword
had been removed, the guard was doubled and instructed
to let none pass&mdash;there might have been a
true samurai among them, though everybody left appeared
to be bent wholly upon saving his own neck.</p>
<p class="indent">Esyo hurriedly disguised herself, for no woman
might safely attend unguarded the battlefield. She
must see Ieyasu, alone, and that quickly. His own
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page292" id="page292"></a>[pg&nbsp;292]</span>
division steadfastly maintained its rigid formation,
expecting as well to be called forthwith into action&mdash;Honda
had intercepted Ieyasu&#146;s threat at its threshold&mdash;but
Hidetada&#146;s routed command continued bolting
headlong in, bearing tales as disconcerting as untimely.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Honda?&#148; whispered she, approaching and beckoning
from the outside.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Yes, my lady,&#148; replied he, as nervously as anxiously.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Is he still alive?&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Y-e-s&mdash;but desperate.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Then let me in, and see that none else approaches.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;I&#146;ll do it,&#148; swore he, in confidence.</p>
<p class="indent">Ieyasu sat with his face buried close in his hands.
Why none had come to strike the stroke that should
save his grace seemed more than he could solve.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Honda,&#148; muttered he, at Esyo&#146;s approach. &#147;Is
there none here, meaner than Honda, to serve me, in
this my last right? Shame upon them, ungrateful
beggars!&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Shame upon you, my lord,&#148; hissed Esyo, her blood
fairly boiling, as she ran directly there. &#147;What do
you mean, by acting in this way?&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">Ieyasu looked up, amazed if relieved. He had mistaken
her for Honda.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Oh, it is you, is it? I thought you safe in Ozaka,
no doubt before this.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Well I might be, and you, too, were you not quite
bent upon insulting others.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page293" id="page293"></a>[pg&nbsp;293]</span>
&#147;I, insult anyone? And who might it be, pray.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Among others, Yodogima, my sister.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Yodogima!&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Yes, Yodogima.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Why so?&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;She just now sends a message, inquiring about your
welfare.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;By whom?&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Kyogoku.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;She loves me still, and I would kill myself? No,
no; I must see her. Esyo; can you arrange it; I
would first meet Yodogima?&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Promise me this: you will keep the engagement.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;I swear it.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Then lend me your sword; I shall have had need
for it before I am returned.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">Over at Ozaka, men bound and eager, to follow up
a significant rout, were massing and ordering and
devising the last and only onslaught that had been
necessary to end a feudalism, throttle an aristocracy,
and implant for good the democracy that Hideyoshi
had all but consolidated.</p>
<p class="indent">Yodogima looked out and over the dazzling troopers,
as they marched and countermarched to orders
flowing from lips she adored as only a mother can.
Hideyori, her son, had come into his own; should
follow up that defeated army, and make doubly sure
glories which were of right only his; would send his
name down to all posterity, as the builder of a commonwealth
founded upon an equality of opportunity
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page294" id="page294"></a>[pg&nbsp;294]</span>
and with favoritism to none. Men and women should
thenceforth develop the ideal that God infixes, share
the real in due proportion, and worship according
to the dictates each of his own untrammelled conscience.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;God bless you, my son; and may He give you
strength to win,&#148; said she, with no other thought encouraging,
as their preparations progressed apace.</p>
<p class="indent">Then, as if fate intervened, she looked toward the
South. The mother instinct had strangely given way,
to that other force, man&#146;s larger comprehension. Love
itself had beamed inconsequently through those rays
illuminating and searching had not a lesser respondent
turned heavenward with glad countenance long before
race or creed echoed the part and powers of an abiding
God.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Kyogoku?&#148; commanded she. &#147;Carry this, a message,
to Ieyasu. Then await, at yonder gate, his
answer.&#148;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXIII</h2>

<p class="indent">Yodogima apparently faltered in the face of
positive victory. Was it soul that stirred her
to larger comprehension, or had God himself intervened
to stay an absolute, a total, the fatal?</p>
<p class="indent">Jokoin came in from the field, aglow with expectation,
fairly dawning and resolving at the prospect
of Hideyori&#146;s famed, unquestioned gallantry. His
furbelows shone out bewilderingly beautiful under the
influence of a risen sun, and her light heart danced
the more in consequence of its apparently disassociated
illusionment&mdash;the food she really relished.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;It&#146;s a jolly fair day, this, Yodogima,&#148; promised she,
bounding in, without so much as a permission. &#147;Have
you seen the artillery? Oh, but it&#146;s an odd looking
thing&mdash;a gun on wheels! I&#146;m sure if Ieyasu had
had one like it he could have made some impression
on these walls. I should like to have seen the fun&mdash;but,
I suppose, it&#146;s lucky there was only one of them
to be had; and luckier still that we&#146;ve got it. We
couldn&#146;t have made out at all without the Christians,
and they&#146;re a bully lot, too; gold is no temptation to
such people.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Perhaps,&#148; remarked Yodogima, unconcernedly&mdash;</p>
<p class="indent">A shell burst near by, in the palace grounds. The
impact deafened them.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page296" id="page296"></a>[pg&nbsp;296]</span>
&#147;Horrors!&#148; exclaimed Jokoin, nestling close under
Yodogima&#146;s shelter.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;I am afraid there must have been two of them,
after all,&#148; surmised Yodogima, attempting to calm the
fears of Jokoin. &#147;But it is too late now, to be firing
at random into the castle. They had better save themselves
the trouble. Oh, well; I shouldn&#146;t mind a little
thing like that; Hideyori shall soon enough put an
end to any further nonsense of the kind. Have courage,
Jokoin.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;I pray they don&#146;t shoot again, this way.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">Esyo had directed a return message in care of Jokoin,
at the hands of Kyogoku; she understood this
particular sister, suspicioned her true proclivities, and
surmising that a well directed shot would startle her
into the activities desired&mdash;should induce the younger
to implore the elder sister&mdash;had, herself, unbeknown
either to her husband or his father, brought into use
an old mortar, a companion piece to the one boasted
of Hideyori, purchased in consequence by Ieyasu at
great expense and stored away safely under cover of
his compound, admiredly, if not for service.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;I&#146;ll give them a taste in advance, of what is to
come,&#148; threatened she, as the inexperienced gunners
fell back in terror and she herself tripped forward to
light the fuse.</p>
<p class="indent">The aim proved blunderingly good: though the citadel
her intended target had been missed, a small addition
to one of the minor buildings was in fact demolished
and some two or three of the occupants&mdash;serving
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page297" id="page297"></a>[pg&nbsp;297]</span>
maids to Yodogima&mdash;were as observed at this
either maimed or killed outright.</p>
<p class="indent">The explosion had its desired effect, and no amount
of assurance or coaxing would or could allay the fears
or quell the anxiety of concerned Jokoin. She must
at once and at all hazards get Yodogima out of that
demoniacal inferno&mdash;her own security quite overlooked&mdash;and
when Kyogoku came in with the message
supposedly from Ieyasu, Yodogima, perhaps to
quiet Jokoin, but more likely to carry out a deeper-laid
plan of her own, readily yielded to her little sister&#146;s
persuasion.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="smcap">&#147;Yodogima:</p>
<p class="indent">Meet me, at Kyogoku&#146;s residence, outside the castle;
I must see you, and would ask no further guarantee
than yours.</p>
<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Ieyasu.&#148;</span></p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">It was all there was of the message&mdash;presumably
an answer to the one she had sent&mdash;yet no greater
influence than Jokoin&#146;s pleading were necessary to
induce an immediate cessation of hostilities on Yodogima&#146;s
part&mdash;insofar as a meeting with Ieyasu was
concerned.</p>
<p class="indent">Hideyori protested. For once his will rebelled
against his mother&#146;s. The opportunity proffering overwhelmed
every other consideration, and the young
man proudly threatened to die behind those walls
rather than let the enemy enter otherwise than as vanquished.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page298" id="page298"></a>[pg&nbsp;298]</span>
&#147;Meet my mother, upon friendly terms? It is impossible!&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;But, my son, Ieyasu out of the way the empire
shall fall directly into your hands; there is none else
to dispute you, and war is&mdash;&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Hell&mdash;all of which Kitagira advised me long ago;
but you see them anxious on all hands&mdash;just now,
since that message was written, a shell has been fired
into our midst. There is no end to fighting as long
as men&#146;s blood runs red.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">Yodogima paused; it had come to a parting with the
one or the other. Blood and love are elemental within
the human, but only for love there had been none
to measure in the light of soul; heart and instinct
might have gone on hand in hand, yet an Infinity&#146;s
unvarying prudence saw fit to match understanding
against the one; love is an affinity.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Then accept my blessing,&#148; urged the mother,
thoughtfully, after a while; &#147;mine is run.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;And give you, as well, my protection; have no
fear; go as you like; do what conscience bids, and
the gods shall render you justice.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Harunaga?&#148; commanded he, directing his further
conversation to him.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Yes, my lord.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Do not call me lord&mdash;not to-day; to-morrow you
may, but if you would serve me now attend my mother;
old men should yet be of some help, and if there
are any others, of a like mind, behind these walls, let
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page299" id="page299"></a>[pg&nbsp;299]</span>
them, too, depart; this is going to be a hot place, perchance
worse, if I interpret Esyo&#146;s message correctly.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Esyo!&#148; gasped Jokoin.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Yes; it is she; and, you are safe at Kyogoku&#146;s.&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;I shall remain here,&#148; replied Jokoin, unobserved by
Yodogima; whose interests had already settled upon
one thought only.</p>
<p class="indent">These went their way, Yodogima accompanied by
Kyogoku, to the latter&#146;s yashiki, a commodious dwelling,
nestled away among the samurai huts fringing
the castle grounds all round well under the outlying
city&#146;s over-crowding borders. It was a sightly place
and a safe one to which the honor-bound Kyogoku, a
trusted intermediary, had led the proud, if anxious,
princess, there to meet and do with life&#146;s final consummation.
The very walls around seemed to echo
some fain portent, in keeping with time&#146;s most cruelly
adjudged, if seemly ending.</p>
<p class="indent">Harunaga lay hidden in the fastness of an humbler
shrine builded farther up on the hillside overlooking
the walls and guarding eagerly each approach. No
deed of the hand or foulness of a heart should harm
or hinder his ladyship&#146;s grace as long as he might
serve; he had divined well her secret, and marshalled
afresh his own hardening courage: sought as best he
knew to induce the moral which every man must finally
know as in prudence wisely revealed.</p>
<p class="indent">She had gone there that Hideyori&#146;s hand might not
be stained, that a nation should rise upon the hard-burned
figments of ambition, that her love attain its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page300" id="page300"></a>[pg&nbsp;300]</span>
just reward, and an ideal come down from heaven to
earth&mdash;a life&#146;s work rounded out in God.</p>
<p class="indent">Weighing over against his own feelings a greater
force, the obligations that he had incurred, this gray-haired
bonze, faith&#146;s most truly devoted, resolved in
his own heart that she had chosen well, and that so
long as he might prevent, her confidence should not
be abused or Ieyasu&#146;s word broken. Harunaga sat
there, as he had lived, the sphinx, grinning against
the gray and the dawn of duty.</p>
<p class="indent">Little birds twittered in the tree-tops, the frosts of
winter threatened coming on, the shadows of evening
were lengthening and casting their grim visages toward
the treasured homestead she had left&mdash;</p>
<p class="indent">Two chairs, one bearing the three asarum leaves,
the other an under man&#146;s crest, came tottering up the
long, crooked, narrow, and overshaded alley-way, the
first ahead and the other after, their heads bobbing
and poles creaking, to the patter of hurrying feet and
bating of heated breaths. Harunaga, springing to his
feet, edged closer to the wall, and peering hard through
its miserly cracks muttered:</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;It is well,&#148; and the two passed on, to their vainly
induced, if death averting, task.</p>
<p class="indent">Dismounting and dismissing the carriers, the two
entered, at one side the larger passage, through a
small, low gate in the massive unscalable stone fence
surrounding the house; leaving and abandoning thus
any means of defence or escape, for the gate once
closed could not be again opened without assistance.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page301" id="page301"></a>[pg&nbsp;301]</span>
Ieyasu apparently bore no weapon at all, and Honda
carried only the customary appendages allowable to a
gentleman of his worth and rank. Harunaga, it would
seem, had adjudged rightly, for he gave the matter no
further concern.</p>
<p class="indent">Kyogoku met them at the inner entrance, in response
to Ieyasu&#146;s loud knocking upon the door-case.</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Welcome, my lord,&#148; vouched the former; whereat
the latter responded:</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Thank you, but not as lord; I seek, am harmless,
hence lordless. I trust I find myself still bidden and
the princess in good parts. May I enter?&#148;</p>
<p class="indent">The leaves upon the trees, standing here and there
like sentinels, rustled gently in the day&#146;s abiding
round, yet there arose out of its vigor as it were the
meaning of a rebirth, the resurrection of man, the inspiration
of soul&mdash;an ever-present God, whom the
grind of time or the compensations of living alone
reveal.</p>
<p class="indent">Conjure that God as we may, borrow if we can,
proclaim Him from the house tops though we do,
worship whom we will, there is no salvation till the
eye has responded to conscience; and going there,
as he did, had Ieyasu but answered to the call that
emanated betwixt duty and neglect? Had Yodogima
found a haven that is neither of the real nor of
the ideal? Had the circle that encompasses encountered
its magnet?</p>
<p class="indent">The broad vistas opening to the eastward carried
their gaze back over the same fields they had but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page302" id="page302"></a>[pg&nbsp;302]</span>
trodden: a Star illuminated the universe, and their
hearts throbbed with the freshness of a regenerated
past. No earthly thing could have parted them: might
a heavenly grace have cemented more deeply the affection
they two had wrought in the fiery cauldron of
human endeavor? Ieyasu bowed low in her presence,
and she responded as no other living thing
responds&mdash;the light of intelligence made certain the
order intended.</p>
<p class="indent">Sitting there, in quiet contemplation, upon the
floating bridge they trod, the future alone bursting
jealously, they greeted each other; he, &#147;How good to
meet a lovely woman&#148;; she, &#147;How lovely to meet an
honorable man&#148;: thence love ruled and blessings
showered.</p>
<p class="indent">Out upon the field, in front, Hideyori thundered
the cry of, &#147;To battle,&#148; and Esyo marshaled, as well,
the hosts against him. War reigned there.</p>
